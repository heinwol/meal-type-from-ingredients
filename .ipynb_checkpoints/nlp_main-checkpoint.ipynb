The wait staff was not only super friendly and efficient, they also seemed completely unfazed by how large the groups was or the fact that most of the kids speak limited English.  The artistic director of the group was celebrating his graduation from college that evening. The staff brought him Flan with a candle on it, turned out the lights, seranaded him, patted him on the back, applauded him. It made him feel so very special.

They are flavored SO well ! The shredded beef is also pretty good.  I dont like their famous chicken however because its on the dry side and not as tender as i anticipated.  I tried it three times just to check if i just got a bad chicken but they are consistently dry.  The complementary garlic bread is pretty delicious too : )\n",

Check your order before walking out of the door. order from here at least twice a month and that always seems to happen.Management here needs to start giving the same level of attention to take out quality control as they do their in diners.They also give me funny looks when i ask for bread with my takeout order.

I loved the freshly sliced onions that topped the chicken and even apologized to my boyfriend before hand because I knew my breath would be kicking later. We tried the Moro this time as a side and I liked it better then the side of white rice and black beans. It was essentially the same but the white rice was cooked with the black beans and loaded with flavor.   We had a huge party of 20 on a Saturday night. Service was great.

Servers are always on their feet making sure customers are satisfied with their meals and if they need anything else. I'm not kidding. They're also very friendly and helpful.

This was one of my favorite reasons for being able to call LA my home for 8 years.  I have since moved back to nor cal, but I still have wet dreams about this place.

AMAZING!!  We just visited the in-laws and dropped by Versailles... it's been about a year or so but it still hit the spot.  I can't stress how much the avo salad really brings this entire dish together, but do yourself a favor and order it.\n",

      "Excellent little place in Santa Monica. My husband and I were passing through and decided to try this place because of a friends suggestion.  Everything from the warm toasty buttery bread, cafe con leche, tostones was awesome .   I am a privileged Puerto Rican from the California bay area and I was lucky enough to have grown up eating my grandmothers authentic delicious food so I can spot a fake in a heart beat! (Cuban food and Puerto Rican food very similar)  This place was delicious, the spices were just right, the meats tender and juicy. The service was prompt and friendly. The ambiance clean, lively, and colorful.   I will definitely  be back when I'm in the area.\n",

      "I still love the ambiance, the service (very attentive and easy to grab when you want something, like extra buttery bread or water), and the food. I still get the chicken with yellow rice ($11.99--prices have gone up but quality seems more consistent as a result), with the chicken cooked to the point that it basically falls off the bone without being dry. The rice is very flavorful and wonderful, and if you like plantains, they are a perfect mix of sweet and sour. The garlic chicken (or other meat) seems better than I remember; before it was so lemony that I couldn't touch it without puckering. But, now it seems quite good, mixed with very fresh (aka potent) slices of white onion. To tone down the flavor a bit, I would encourage you to go for the pork rather than chicken, or perhaps get the combo and try both ($13.99). The mango and guanabana smoothies are a bit pricier than I recall, now a little bit steep at $3.99, and are rather dilute and weak in flavor. If you want to try something new and richer, go for the mamey. Overall, aside from parking, which can be tight if you are able to get a spot and the high volume of conversation inside, it is a good place with good food in good portions. I will likely be back another time for dinner and perhaps for happy hour, for I noticed they have $3 mojitos from 6-8pm!!\n",

      "Sangria, Plantains, and best of all, Bob Saget.  I've been coming here for several years now, and I have always loved this place. The menu has stayed the same, but visually has changed drastically! It started off as a dingy paper menu years ago but now it's fancy, complete with pictures!  Let me just say first of all that the parking situation here, particularly on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, is terrible. Thankfully I live a short walking distance away so I take a stroll out there every now and then to enjoy a glass (or pitcher!) of sangria. Thankfully I am a stone's throw away from this Versailles location.  More on the sangria. It just has the right taste. Just enough sweetness, plenty of tang, with a few slices of orange. I can plow through this like fruit punch, hell almost like water. It's dangerous. Being a brand new graduate student at UCLA a few years ago, there was nothing better than driving over (yep, dangerous) to Versailles (when I didn't live anywhere near it) and having a pitcher of sangria for $14.99 after a hard day. Unfortunately, those days are over. I can't handle a pitcher of sangria anymore, merely a glass or two. But to my benefit, I don't spend as much money. The sangrias prices have upped to $19.99 per pitcher and remained at about $3.99 per glass.  Also... their bread! Devastatingly simple. They cut off pieces of freshly (daily) baked bread, toast it and spread some butter sauce on top. Just enough to get it a little soaked, but make the paper they deliver it on absolutely clear. Yes, some cardiac arrest is in the works, but oh so worth it at Versailles. Sometimes I must ask for a second order.  I usually stick with the whole chicken, the roast pork, or the fried pork chunks (sorry, I can't remember the numbers) and I am always happy. ALWAYS. You may think that is \"oil\" at the bottom of your roast pork or chicken pile, but no, that is their special marinade, dubbed \"Mojo sauce\". It is a very tangy, lemon-y mixture that they grill, fry, and cook everything with at their establishment.  Even more fantastic is that they include with nearly every dish, a solid helping of moro (black beans within!) rice, and my personal favorite, plantains! You may not expect it, but mix the beans and rice together, and with the excess dip your plantains. Heck, dip your plantains in the excess moro sauce. Soaking up the tangy/salty juices along with the contrast of the sweet plantains? HEAVEN. Absolute perfection.  Another dish I also enjoy here (and had tonight!) is the Cuban Sandwich. A nice helping of pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard on a 9-10 inch roll along with a generous slice of ham and roasted pork leg to top it off. Throw on some tapatillo sauce and some ketchup for your fries and you've got yourself a perfect meal that you can take on the go in a pinch! I've done that meal for lunch many times, switching off to the Bistec (steak) sandwich as well as the roast pork sandwich. Fortunately they recently updated the menu to allow you to get the sandwich/fries meal for dinner. For many years, this was not possible and they told you so.  And what do you know?! A celebrity sighting! Bob Saget and his girlfriend were sitting at the table behind us. They had the whole chicken and the roasted pork. I like his choices (AND his style)!  I go back here at least once every couple of weeks. Unfortunately I have to limit myself... I don't want to get too tired of Versailles!\n",

      "Bad Service and Bad Food = Major Fail.  We got seated and figured out quickly what we wanted to order. I raised my hand like a good 4th grade student but everyone ignored me.  My friend tried to flag down a server and even after making eye contact with 2, no one came to help us. Eventually, a server who was helping the table next to us stopped by to take our order.  I got the Tamales appetizer (2 pork tamales) and my friend ordered Bistec de Pollo.  My tamales were ok but there was very little pork.  In fact, I would say that pork made up about 5% of each tamal.  The sauce it was in was not bad but the abundance of completely raw onions on top of the dish was not appetizing.  My friend's chicken was hard, cold and not good at all.  He said that he could make better chicken at home and he's no gourmet chef.  It was also topped with enough onions to make an army cry but at least his onions were slightly cooked.  The plantains that came with the dish were pretty good but how can anyone mess up frying plantains, right? The side of rice that came with the dish was stale and clumpy.  Yuck!  In summary, I have nothing good to say about this place and I don't need onion breath.\n",

YUM.  I love this place.  I think that this Versailles is the most tasty of all the Versailles.  I'm not sure why...if the cook is different or what....but the steaks, plantains, and rice are more moist.    I can't decide on one dish over another....but being the meat eater I am, I love the ropa vieja (shredded marinated meat) and the Bistec de palomilla (grilled new york steak with onions).   Depending on what kind of flavor I feel like, I choose between these two.  BUT I mostly get the Bistec de Palomilla.    My friends and hubs really loves the garlic chicken.  I'm not a fan of chicken, but I have had a bite of this dish, and it is delicious.   Let me just warn you that coming here will definitely deter you away from a night of \"first kisses\" and juvenile make out sessions as your breath will smell like garlic.   No breath mint or anything will take it away because if its not in your mouth, its in your breath.  So if you plan on bringing a date here, make sure its not a first date...and def make sure you're not trying to impress someone with a little lip action later....hahahaha....\n",

      "Finally got down here tonight and I'm glad I did. I was very excited to try Versailles, been on the bookmark list for a while! Of course, I ordered the Garlic Chicken #6 and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is pretty chill, nice atmosphere. Nothing fancy and nothing dumpy. Just a nice relaxing place to have a hearty/tasty meal.   -The Bread that they give you to start off with was pretty good. The bread itself was warm and toasty, just way to much butter on it though! It almost tasted like Popcorn from the theaters. It's just too much in my opinion before dinner.   -The Garlic Chicken was good. It didn't \"Blow\" me away, but it was for sure tasty. Other reviews were not lying when they said this thing was garlicky! Damn, I for sure wouldn't go here on a date for the first time and get this. Unless I was married or had been dating a girl for a long time! You could kill someone with that garlic baby! The chicken was moist on the inside and perfect combo of soft and crispy skin on the outside. I really enjoyed it flavors, maybe just a tad less garlic though.   -The rice that comes with it was good. Nothing special, it could have been cooked a little bit more but never the less was decent. The beans that came with the dish were not that special on their own by any means, very runny. So I decided to mix the beans in with the white rice. This came together well and made both taste much better. The plantains were good, but I have had better. They put them on the side of the chicken so all that garlic/lemony zest gets mixed in and it didn't taste good, at all. They just don't go well together. The plantains were somewhat soggy. I wasn't a big fan of the Raw onions on top of the chicken, I just moved them off to the side.  -The service was very friendly and very quick. the food doesn't seem to take too long which is good if you aren't into making it a long dinner. It seems like a good spot for a quick bite, but not for a date if you are like trying to get to know someone and maybe want a more intimate setting.

      "I've been eating way too well.  this is what I told myself before we headed out to Versailles this afternoon.  \"Maybe I'll just do something light like a salad or a side or something.\"  Who the hell am I kidding?  Its been probably ten years since my last visit to Versailles (last time off La Cienega) and this location was every bit as memorable as the last time.  Based on other Yelp reviews, we went with the #1 and #6.  Both were excellent.  I love pork but not a huge fan of sour.  But to be honest, I couldn't help myself from eating the pork, sour as it was.  The big surprise was the ox tail and pork sliders.  Fantastic.  Tres Leche Cake was unbelievable with the cafe Cubano.  Out of this world...  Well, at least like nothing we can get down here behind the Orange curtain.  now I need to run off those extra calories...\n",

Maybe I should have tried the fried pork chunks instead. I also thought the marinade took a bit too much away from all that pork goodness. The rice for the arroz con pollo was very flavorful and cooked nicely, though the chicken was a tad dry. Dinner came with a basket of bread.  Wait: I've only been here on weekends and have never had to wait for a table. The food comes out quickly, within 10-15min for a party of 2.

And the service was Below Par. We were seated in a rush, rushed to order, and rushed to leave. Was the place packed? No. So why the pushy atmosphere? I was told \"this is just how Cubans act sometimes.\" Eh, rather not come back then.

The flavor was good but I thought it came out to sightly too dry. Came with rice and beans (these beans were heaven!) I wish the bowl of beans were bigger haha.   The tamales were heaven as well!

It can be tough to find great Cuban food outside of South Florida, so Versailles is the next best thing. Havana-like atmosphere, Cuban tunes playing, waiters dressed in cubavera shirts, only thing missing is the cigars. The place is spacious.  I opted for the classic dish: Lomo Salteado - Rib Eye Steak  Simmered in tomato sauce with onions and bell peppers and served atop fried potatoes.  It was just plain delicious. Beef was tender and the fried potatoes made me feel like a man. Black beans and rice is one of my favorite things. The plantains gave the dish the needed sweet flavor.

Also, be careful not to ask for more bread or you will be charged extra! Don't ask for those onions, an additional charge applies for the onions that a traditional Cuban dish would have.

Being a HUGE fan of pork, I ordered the Lechon Asada (sp?).  There was just way too much fat and a pile of hugely cut raw onions that I really didn't know what to do with.  The thing that saved this dish? The RICE and that sour, garlicy sauce drizzled all over the pork. Weird, huh?  On my way out, I ordered, to-go, their famous Versailles Chicken plate in HOPES that it would live up to its name. IT DID NOT. The chicken was just horribly dry and to top it off, there wasn't enough sauce. :(  Look, this place is okay. It's definitely not a BAD restaurant, but I must say ... I was significantly disappointed with the food, especially after reading a good amount of fabulous reviews. Perhaps, I caught them on an off day?  I'll stop by if I'm ever around, but I'm not sure I'll go out of my way.\n",

Service was top-notch, and the portions are enormous, making the $$ notation really a $ unless you eat enough for 4. The bread before the meal was amazing and I couldn't stop munching on it.  I ordered the lechón asado, which was very well seasoned but a bit dry for my taste. (I would have ordered their famous chicken if I weren't afraid that it would have been wayyyy too dry as chicken usually is.) The plantains were delicious, and the rice and beans... were rice and beans. I wasn't a big fan of the raw onions on top, but they were really good the next day!  Since I only ate a third of my plate and a friend gave me a third of hers, I had enough lechón and onions to experiment with the next day. For lunch, I browned the onions and reheated the pork in it for a bit, making the onions much more palatable and the pork a tiny bit less dry. For dinner, I put the remaining pork on a sandwich--also yummy.  Next time, I'll order the ropa vieja. If they could manage to make ropa vieja dry... they wouldn't have gotten such good ratings.  Also, their corkage fee is almost $11! Do not b.y.o. if you're on a budget....\n",

      "My friend Jen A. told me that I'd love this place, so we braved Santa Ana winds, downed power lines, and a slew of blacked out stoplights to have dinner here last night.   As everyone says, the bread is ridiculously good: crusty, buttery and bottomless. We didn't request more, but it just kept coming. Then we had the idea to dip it in their cilantro cream sauce, which just made it to die for. $1.50 for a side of the most amazing cilantro cream sauce I've ever had? A bargain!  We ordered the Famoso Pollo Versailles with Moro and the Lomo Salteado with beans and rice to share. For me, the chicken with the garlicky lemony sauce and fresh onions was really interesting, but the acidity of the sauce takes getting used to (and I love anything acidic) so it wasn't something I was ready to eat an entire portion of. I'd definitely eat it again, and luckily my friend is in love with it. However, the Lomo Salteado  was right up my alley on a windy evening, warm and stewy. Next time I'll skip the fries (which would be great if I wanted to be fat), because blending the beans, rice, and tomato-y sauce together made the most delicious mashed up rice side dish ever. The ribeye steak pieces were tender but not mushy (I like my meat to bite back a bit), and went amazingly with the cilantro cream sauce. The bits of pepper, tomato, and onion were stewed to perfection, and we both had leftovers for lunch.  I know everyone recommends the Moro, but I actually preferred the rice and beans separate, then mixing them myself, because the rice was much more moist and fluffy that way. The service was pretty good, though a little slow to take our order, and they refilled our drinks readily. She even described how to make the cilantro cream sauce at home, which I'm definitely going to try. The prices are decent for the quality and large portions of delicious Cuban fare, and there was enough free parking outside for everyone.\n",

      "Dropped by for lunch with the wife after running some errands on the west side.  Even for a late lunch (1:30pm) the place was still near capacity.  It had been years since the last time I had been to this location (but I drop in the Manhattan Beach location every few months)  and I always order the same thing:  1/2 chicken with beans and rice.    This time they had a special on the blackboard that intrigued me:  Cuban Sliders.  So, I decided to give it a try.  When I ordered the sliders, the waiter gave me a blank look.  So, I pointed to the board and he looked for what felt like a minute (like he was reading it for the first time)  and scribbled it down along with my wife's chicken order.  The meals came out taking slightly longer than we expected but it was not a long wait.    My wife's order came out as usual; delicious with a nice tang to the lemon garlic sauce.  Rice and bean perfectly cooked and an amazing compliment to the chicken.  The fried plantains had some slight off flavors that I couldn't quite place but it wasn't much of an issue overall.  The sliders were surprisingly good!  They were roasted pork, skillet fried with a slice of pickle and cilantro sauce in between slightly sweet buns. The pork had a nice little crunch to it which made it all the better.  As an aside, I think I was the first person to order it since three different people came out to see how I like it.  Personally I think if they took a few dollars off and halved the order size I think it would make a perfect appetizer to a nice sized dinner.  Bottom line:  Even after all these years, Versailles hasn't lost their touch with great food and are willing to expand their menu ( I don't mind, even if I am the guinea pig! ).\n",

      "Versailles is earning my VERY FIRST 3 star rating.  Now to the why.    Everything in this place screams a 1:   -It's in the ghetto -The patrons are kind of scary (one lady approached me and told me she was a prophet from God, then proceeded to remove her socks and shoes and rub her feet whilst explaining to me that she broke her arm, and since her husband is an armed guard he couldn't help her, so God miraculously healed it (don't all arm breaks heal eventually?  Not that I don't believe in God, just sayin').  She then proceeded to stand up posthaste and yell, \"WELL, I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE\".  A peculiar phrase for a prophet.  Next, I watched a woman deliberately and forcefully spit her gum onto the car parked next to hers before speeding off) -My waiter was terrible (he literally did not speak and brought me a soda I didn't ask for nor did I drink, then later charged me for it) -My steak was cold (and not just \"it was sitting there while it waited on the rest of the food\" cold, cause I would have ate that, it was \"it didn't defrost completely\" cold -My replacement steak (while warm) was bland and had a rubbery consistency (a lot of salt helped the bland issue) -The list goes on, but this is getting long...  So why the 3 you ask?  Well, I consider myself a fair person, and since going gluten free in 2011 (I wish I had started in '03 so that would rhyme), the only thing I could safely eat there was the steak (they don't have an allergen menu and I got a dumbfounded look when I asked if there was wheat, flour, or gluten in their sauces).  Not being Cuban, I'm not sure if steak would constitute as authentic Cuban food, so I don't want to put the rest of their food under the same scrutiny as their lousy steak.  The food of my fellow dinees looked delicious, and they seemed to love it.    HENCE MY FIRST THREE!!!\n",

As noted, the Garlic Chicken is something you want to try. It's a huge piece of chicken too, they don't play games there with the portions.   I also like the Vaca Frita, which is pretty much shredded beef marinated with olive oil and citrous flavors. Very flavorful! And the generous portion of slightly sauteed onions on top of the meat....mmmmmm what a simple yet delicious combination.  Not sure how they're cooking the black beans that come along with each dish, but they are loaded with flavor as well and compliment any of the meats whether it may be chicken, beef, or pork.   Tamales are delicious as well.  Service is always friendly although sometimes it may get busy and they can be on the slow side.  Not a big fan of their complimentary bread, it's \"heavily\" drizzled with oil and not that great. But I wouldn't waste time or space eating it, just wait a little for the bigger and better entree.  A huge plus +++++ SO MANY PARKING SPACES! Parking is never a problem here, which, if you live in LA or come to LA often, you know parking is always the biggest issue.\n",

Unfortunately my favorite part of the meal turned out to be anything but the Chicken; the skin was bark-tough and the chicken itself was not close to tender and closer to super tough. Maybe Cubans like their chicken tough but I am definitely not a fan. Unfortunately there wasn't anything else about the meal to rave about.  The prices are not all bad for a sit-down place and I'm definitely willing to come here again to try something else; namely some of their beef or seafood offerings.

For dessert, I had the Flan Cubano.  It was quite good and it was a small sized sweet to end a great meal.  The place was very busy and very noisy, but it was a fun atmosphere with people having conversations and laughing - a nice kind of noisiness.  There was one cranky infant whose parents needed a kick, but that was the only downer.

The service was fast and attentive.  The menus have changed since the last time I was here.  They are nicer and more elegant with photographs.  I also discovered that Versailles has a special parking lot on the west side of the restaurant that I've never seen before.  Has that always been there?!  Good to know if you ever can't find a spot in front of the restaurant.\n",

Tamales: My boyfriend felt like tamales.  I didn't like it and I stopped picking at it to save some stomach room.  It was a bit mushy and wet.  Even the yummy lemony garlic sauce couldn't get me to eat it.  I prefer Mexican tamales more.  Famoso Pollo Versailles: Roasted half chicken with slice onions and plantains served with a side of rice and black beans.  The chicken is drenched in a lemony garlic sauce.  It seriously is all about the sauce.  The chicken is moist and the plantains might have been a little greasy, but I couldn't really tell because it's drenched in sauce and the acidity of the sauce probably killed most of the grease.  Even if the chicken is a bit dry, it wouldn't matter because the sauce is so garlicky tangy that you salivate as you chew!  Even after you shallow each bite, the sauce is so strong it lingers for a few seconds.  Be careful to not drool in between bites.  There's nothing too special about the rice and beans.  It's just there.

Felt like someone decided... \"hey! you know what would be fun? Let's try to make CUBAN food!\" then all their friends applauded. My food was literally not edible. Here's how it went down...  Beans: clearly not soaked for a day, maybe salted. but def no bay leaf, or cumin or onions or any kind of flavor that resembles hispanic. they were nasty.  Halibut: was soaked in butter. that's it. this made me throw up in my mouth a little. which made me taste the nasty beans again. vicious cycle.   rice: overcooked and barely seasoned. why are these people cooking?!  Yucca (broiled) : this is not an easy thing to prepare so I would have given them a free card but they pissed me off with the other food so too bad for them. it was bad, bland and mushy. I tasted way too much pepper and hardly any garlic. Prepared correctly Yucca with mojo is one of my favorite things on this green good planet. This version was sacrilegious.   Mojo: this made me mad. but I'm Cuban so I'm often mad. This was literally a cup of greasy oil. That's all. C'mon people! they sell the Goya version AT LEAST.  and finally...  Batido de Mamey (Mamey Milkshake): Mamey is a delicious fruit that I'm sure you couldn't screw up. We are talking about milk, mamey and ice. or ice cream and mamey. I had mamey flavored water. Which would have been fine if that's what I asked for, but I asked for a Milkshake. Sadly, my Milkshake was watery so none of the boys came to my yard.   Don't waste your time or your money.

      "I have been coming here for years and never really gave any thought to how I would rate this place or what I would write. I recently ate at another local Cuban place, and it really opened my eyes to how good I've had it at Versailles.   Every time I have come here, I've had a good meal. Every. Single. Time. The chicken is always juicy and tender and smothered in that awesome marinade. I don't even like onions that much, raw onions even less so, but when I come here I always ask for extra onions and extra marinade. Smother my food in that stuff and I will be happy. If I could actually finish the mounds of food, I would lick my plate.  No too long ago, my father mentioned that he hadn't had liver &amp; onions in ages. I looked around for days trying to find a restaurant that offered liver &amp; onions and was pleasantly surprised to discover that Versailles had it on the menu. That slab of liver was so big, my dad made three meals out of it. My mother, who had never had Cuban food before couldn't stop talking about the chicken and how much she liked it.  I'll never cheat on you again, Versailles. We are totally BFF.\n",

But you can't deny their wall of pics of Hollywood high rollers.  We didn't see TMZ anywhere because there were no stars that night.  Anyway, so we were hoping to play footsie, este, eat some Ropa Vieja while we were here.    We ordered the popular garlic chicken.  My cousin, who has a voracious appetite, ate most of it.  I've tasted Ropa Vieja from 3 Cuban restaurants.  This place was my 3rd favorite.  It's a family oriented place.  Laid back.  It's possible for parking to be a pain.  I give them 3.5 stars.\n",

Went here for lunch on a Saturday (around 11:30ish) and there was only 1 other table occupied.   Servers were just \"hanging out\" at the bar and talking on their cell phones (fine, do whatever since there are no customers).  We ordered Combo #1 (Pork and Garlic Chicken Platter) $13.99, Camarones Enchilados (Shrimp in Creole sauce) $16.99, Mango Milkshake $3.50, Iced Tea $1.99  Total after tax was around $39.66 so we provided a credit card and waited for our bill.   Once we received the credit card bill to sign, we noticed that the amount increased to $43!!!    My husband was still kind enough to tip them but he listed each of the items individually along with the prices on the final receipt and calculated our tip from the over-charged total that they had presented to us!

Here comes the review  Food: My friend instantly goes, \"Wanna share the garlic chicken??\" I reply with a \"Uh...yes, garlic anything is YUM\". As  sit there waiting for my garlic chicken..they bring over a basket of bread.  It was warm and crunchy and of course, slathered with oodles of butter! (I know...not very healthy, but hey, i'm on vacation and why not right?) Then, finally, they bring the plate of garlic chicken. Oh, my,goodness. One plate was def. enough for my friend and I to share.  The chicken comes with grilled plantains, with a side of rice and black beans. I used the beans as a sauce for my rice and let me tell you this...it was magnificent! i was slightly sad when I quickly finished my portion of the rice and there was still a bowl of beans left. Now, for the the chicken.  They totally marinated the chicken to perfection. It literally was fall off the bone! Not too salty but really garlic-y. I'm drooling just thinkin about it. (Not that it's cause it's 4 am and I'm sorta hungry)  Service: The waiters were all very nice.  Recommended my friend the pork which I didn't really try.  She told us about the slight portion size between lunch and normal menu.  All the staffs were very nice.\n",

      "I'm generally disappointed with Cuban food but this place hit the spot and my taste buds perfectly.  It's a friendly family atmosphere with a menu that includes every type of meat you'd expect and a few daily specials that sounded fantastic, including fresh fish.  We started with the potato balls which were the best we'd had (light, fluffy with a good meat filling) and the pork tamales which were the best I've had, delicious.  What do you eat in a new restaurant that everyone rates?  Their speciality of course, and in Versailles it was a Garlic chicken.  Half a roasted chicken in their lemony-garlicky sauce, with fried plantains, rice and beans.  Fantastic.  The chicken sauce was light but very full flavoured and the meat moist and drop off the bone.  The sides were perfect also. Washed down with 2-3 beers.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes here.\n",

My go-to is always the Garlic Chicken (Pollo Versailles), a good portion of chicken slathered in lemony garlic sauce and onions. I also like the beans from Versailles, although I couldn't put my finger on why. The plantains are always tasty little morsels; sweet and fried to perfection.

Luckily he's a freak like me, so I was able to enjoy something I'd never tried before: ink! The #40 (Squid and Rice) is a paella-inspired dish of purply, salty goodness not for the faint of heart. Also got a nibble of the oxtail with plantains, which was tender, incredibly tasty, and served on the bone (vertebrae! sooo cool!). Atmosphere isn't anything special, but at least you get seated and served in a timely fashion.   Nice pick, Cobra Kai. :)\n",

      "After hearing horror stories about Cuban food in California, we were a little hesitant to try any. But after a few weeks out of Miami, we were craving Cuban food enough to try some. Having a Versailles in Miami, it was a no brainer as to where we would go.  The decor and the music were great. Mexican waiters in guayaberas? Super cute! Seriously, the service was pretty good-definitely with better attitudes than the Cuban joints in Miami. They were out of the Matervas we ordered  , but before we could say anything, our waiter suggested a Jupiña. Nicely done.  We weren't that hungry to order meals and were in the mood for a sandwich so we ordered an order (2) of croquettas, an order (2) of tamales, and a pan con bistec (steak sandwich).  They brought out the necessary Cuban meal staple: bread and butter, but it wasn't Cuban bread. Eh, I didn't pay mind to it because it was nice and full of buttery goodness.  The tamales came out first. They were much bigger than my husband and I were used to ever having eaten. On a positive note, it did have more meat than we had ever had in a tamale. Delicious. A little hot sauce is the perfect companion.  Next came our croquettas. Sadly, we were disappointed in these. They were small and their taste was reminiscent of a familiar frozen brand. While somewhat disappointed at the size and taste, I AM biased because I love croquettas and have rarely found an inedible one.  Finally, our pan con bistec came-we did share the sandwich. Before talking about that, I do have to mention that the sandwich selection was very tiny. I don't even think I saw a Media Noche on there (unless I looked over it)-that's just crazy. Back to the sandwich, the steak itself was delicious!! Perfectly marinated and a perfect consistency. Unbelievable!!  They added cheese upon our request and it was good. I can't speak for myself regarding the grilled onions as I don't eat them, but my husband says they are not TOO grilled or soft, therefore leaving a slight crunchiness to the sandwich. What just made me a little sad was that that sandwich did NOT use Cuban Bread. WHAT WHAT WHAT?!?! That is where I draw the line. A pan con bistec made with bread other that Cuban is insanity. Oh well, thanks to the steak, the sandwich was, indeed, tasty. The bread used was a little chewy.  Folks seem to be raving over the garlic chicken and they even have oxtail on the menu. Overall, the food wasn't bad, the service was great, and it serves as a pretty decent choice when you're craving Cuban food.\n",

      "so ive never really tried cuban food so when i came here i wasnt sure what to order. i saw that they had Lomo Saltado on their menu so I decided to try that since I LOVEE peruvian style lomo saltado and i wanted to see how cuban lomo saltado compared  the portions are big here, so consider sharing an order with a friend! the lomo saltado was reaally good. it was cooked in tomato sauce with fries, onions, veggies, and fried plantains. i really enjoyed the fried plaintains! they were fried with some yummy sauce or some kinda drizzle and it was really amazing and sweet. their moro is also pretty good. I was impressed by the flavor of their moro since i just though it would taste like rice and beans.. it didnt. It definitely had more flavor than i thought it would have.   my boyfriend got the #1 Pork order off their menu. it was supposed to be garlic flavored pork or something.. i thought his pork was really flavorful; almost too flavorful. it almost had a salty taste to it since there was so much flavor.   hmm overall i think this is a good place to eat cuban food. it seems pretty authentic to me\n",

Being bicoastal, we have had many great dinners at Versailles Cuban restaurant in Miami's Little Havana. Unfortunately, they are not the same owners.  Dinner was very good, by far the best Cuban food I have had on the West (Best) Coast. The Lechon was very tender and the Garlic Chicken was so flavorful. The service was very good - they checked on us many times and couldn't be friendlier (my wife being very beautiful and speaking Spanish is always a plus).  The drive from the OC was a little much, but overall it was great and we will do it again. It gave us an excuse to enjoy other things in nearby areas.\n",

I would endure the smelly burps and heart attack-like pains to eat there again.

Knowing it's nearly impossible to study a menu when we're meeting, I decided ahead of time on a tamal, a Cubano sandwich, and a mamey milkshake.  Everything was great.  We were there at lunchtime on a Sunday, and the crowd was just right.  I've heard it can be a zoo for dinner.  $10-$20 per person.  Parking out front is kinda squished, so park around the side instead.  4 stars.\n",

I had the Versailles chicken the other night.  The meat was extremely tender and juicy and although it was a half chicken and more than enough food I felt that I could've kept eating if there was more in front of me.  Most of my friends got the #1 (pork) which is always a good choice.  The meat melts in your mouth.  Another friend got the strip steak and absolutely loved it.  We shared a pork tamale as an appetizer.  I'm not generally a fan of tamales but this one was pretty good (although i probably would order it on my own).  Oh, and the sangria was delicious.

Garlic sauce had a more sour taste than I was expecting but was also quite delicious. Wasn't expecting an entire, succulent half chicken either. Another great surprise!

This was one of the few times in my life that I could not bring myself to eat any of my food. I also ordered a mango smoothie, and typically I'll like anything with mango in it no matter what-- well, this was  the ONE time in my life that I did not like something mango-related.

The plantains, beans and rice were all delicious.  And I also had the fried yucca which was delicious.  I went there on a Friday night and we were seated immediately, so that was nice.  All the employees were very nice and accommodating, but then we were asked so many times how our food was that it definitely started to seem like they wanted us to leave, even though we really hadn't been there very long.

Have no fret if you see a line outside cuz it will move super fast just like service once you have ordered your food. They must have alot of the food basically ready to go because seriously once you have been seated the food comes out lightning fast.   This past Friday Nate and I went here and shared the pork plate with mojo sauce (I think its #1 on the menu) We also ordered a side of yucca with some more mojo sauce. The last time we came here I think we each ordered our own plates and we were totally stuffed along with the side of tostones (green plantains that taste like potato) excellent with some salt and black beans on them!! Also we were going to the Amanson afterward and my leftovers filled the car with garlicky smells for days!

      "Oh Versailles, how I would love to praise thee...  ... but I just can't. I've been to Versailles twice now (I know, only twice-- don't get your panties all up in a bunch) and am not convinced. The restaurant itself looks like a place I would automatically love. Cool sign with its huge obtrusive (in a good way) logo on the outside. Old-school homey interior, friendly staff ... I dig all that stuff.   But, I keep hearing and reading how the Versailles lemon-roasted chicken is so good. Well, I've had it twice and not only can I not recommend it, but I will not eat it again. It's not so BAD, it's just NOT GOOD and that makes me sad.   The chicken arrives at your table and by its appearance, you're just ready to dive in. Carcass intact, golden-brown skin, adorned with sliced raw onions... Then you take a bite. Hmmm... pretty dry... not much flavor. Well, maybe just the breast meat is dry... that's passable I guess (actually in a restaurant it shouldn't be passable). So I go for the thigh, my favorite part of a chicken. Dark meat's gotta be juicy, right? Wrong. Dry again! Are you kidding me???   Saddened by this (and somewhat desperate at this point), I cut off some meat from the drumstick, tear off a good amount of skin to accompany it, put some of the raw onion on top, drag it through the lemon sauce and go for it. Okay not bad, but again, do you want to go out to eat and have \"not bad\"? I don't.   I should mention here that the lemon sauce shouldn't really be thought of as \"sauce\", let's be honest. It's actually just half a notch above lemon juice. It kinda tastes like the lemon juice that comes in those plastic lemons with the green cap at the supermarkets. Toss in some garlic powder... there you have it.  My friends still love that chicken though. Actually, I am envious. I want to like it. I guess my opinion of the lemon chicken at Versailles is best summarized in this (partial) quote by Jonathan Gold of LA Weekly:  \"Everybody but me, it appears, adores the crisp-skinned roast chicken at he Cuban restaurant Versailles...\"  Why not pan the place? Well, I'm sure they have other things at Versailles that I might like. The menu has alot of alternatives. I tried the Cuban sandwich. It was very good. I want to try some pork the next time my friends are eating their friggin' chiggin (jab, jab).  Again, the place just looks and feels like a place I should love. I'm trying...\n",

Enter and order.    Everything tender, juicy, and well marinated/seasoned.  The flavor blends here are magical.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.    We can never resist the siren call of the pork and chicken combo with fried plantains, rice and beans.  Garlic, lime, vinegar and onions all meld together with the tender-perfectly cooked meats.  The pork is tender and soft while the chicken is crisp yet juicy. I even munch on the nasty rib bones of the chicken to get every tangy bit off.  I am a Versailles whore.  Combo any bite with a bit of sweet plantain or savory rice/bean combo and each bite is new and different.    I also love the ropa vieja \"old clothes\"  a stewed beef with tomato and peppers that is so good and homey.  I wish my mom cooked like that.    Always get the batido de mamey for the toddler and we always chug half of it's sweet, tropical goodness.

After visiting the mummies we enjoyed some fried pork chunks, Versailles garlic chicken, fried plantains, baked plantains and moros.  It was all tasty and delicious, especially the fried plantains. Service was good, food arrived quickly and was reasonably priced. The parking situation is kind of odd, but it worked just fine for us.

We went to Versailles ( on Venice) I have heard of this place and frequently pass the one on La Cienega, but I never stopped to get a bite.  Well, all that chenged today.   I would bless them with 5 stars, however, our waiter did not bring us water nor did he ask if we wanted any water. Water? That's a common courtesy for all diners to be at least offered, isn't  it?  Anyhoo, I ordered  bar-b-que chicken.  Actually I had half of a roasted bar-b-que chicken smothered in sweet &amp; spicy sauce - that was so delicious! The sides were fried sweet plantains and balck beans and rice, the sides were good as well.   To drink I had raspberry iced tea..  Overall I enjoyed my lunch, there was a nice crowd and everyone was engaged in their  own conversation ( if you don't like people chatting over a good meal this place is not for you). They were not annoying at all just chatty.  The seating is ample we were seated right away. The prices are modest and parking - the lot can get packed but we found a park as soon as we pulled up.  I recommend Versailles. If you haven't been GO!. There are 5 locations, 2 in LA, 1 in Encino, 1 in Manhattan Beach and 1 @ Universal City Walk.\n",

Ok, ok that's two items but trust me, this combination will not dissapoint!  If it's your b'day, they'll turn off all the lights, come to your table with some of that oh so yummy flan (with a candle), and have everyone in the restaurant sing happy birthday to you!

I had the chicken and pork combination dish on recommendation and it was very good. The chicken was saoked in the garlic juice which is great because even if you are the type of person not to eat the skin the meat is full of flavor. The pork was tender and went well with the rice and black beans.  If I had any complaints, it would be that the food was very oily. The bread basket that they give before your meal had a puddle of oil left over on the bottom and the meat was swimming in it. Its hard to really complain about this because a lot of the flavor comes from the oil itself.  The best part is the price. All the prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food that you get.\n",

The roast pork platter was slightly less garlicky and this would be my default order if I was to come here regularly.  I recommend adding some hot sauce to the garlicky pork.  Atmosphere is so-so.  They have drinks but this is more a restaurant than bar/restaurant - i.e., you wouldn't hang out here unless you were eating.  I'm surprised how much of an institution this restaurant mini-chain is in LA.  In NYC, this would just be considered a solid, maybe slightly above average Cuban restaurant....\n",

The dish had salmon, specks of chorizo, a scallop, some tough shrimp, greenlip mussels, baby clams, calamari, with some good yellow rice.

And I had to ask for extra napkins when the food can clearly get messy. The place was not that full today and there were other service people sitting up near the front so it was not that busy.  Food quality was very good. We ordered a bunch of dishes. The chicken and pork combo plate was good. Their pork is amazingly flavorful with a tang of citrus. The fried whole snapper was very good - perfectly fried and seasoned. The chicken arroz con pollo was one of the best I've had. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned with juicy chicken falling off the bone. The coffee latte was excellent.   The 2 let downs were the beef stew (meat was too chewy) and the french fries which were over cooked inside even though the outside looked okay.  My favorite was the flan with the coconut shaved topping. The flan was eggy to the right amount with lots of caramel sauce but the kicker was the shaved coconut heap at the top. Great ending to a meal in conjunction with coffee.   If you go here...be prepared to work off the calories and hopefully you get a better waiter than we did today.

First, they got new menus from the last time I went...which explained the HIGHER PRICES. I usually get their chicken, but I wanted to try something different since one of my friends was already getting that.  I got the \"Leg of Pork,\" which is #3.  a) Too tough! I felt like I was eating pieces of plywood.  b) Too salty! I had to wash it in the black beans to eat it...  c) Too tangy! Did they double the amount of lemon in the recipe or something? I finished the entire cup of water (and I wasn't offered more).   d) Oh, even the black beans were saltier than I remembered...but actually, this was okay. It tasted better.  e) The free \"garlic\" bread was just french bread...no flavor!  The only same thing was the slow service, which I'll let it slide since I know they're popular and busy.

My dad ordered #6 (the half chicken) and I ordered #1 (pork).  Our food came out faster then a McDonald's Drive-thru!    Aside from that, our food was just straight lemon juice and a pound of salt, oh and to top it off with some raw onion slices.  I could make this sh*t at home.  No wonder America is freaking #1 in obesity, diabetes, and high/low blood pressure.    Maybe I'll come back for their tamales, but that's it!!!\n",

Yet there were all the tables, surrounding me, shoving it all in.  In front of me, mushy grease.  Same as last time.    People have mentioned the waiters...and I've had the same problem...after they take your order, you're lucky to ever see them again.  Only time we did is when he brought the credit card back (yet he didn't take it).    Sometimes, reputation keeps a restaurant in business...and if these other reviews are any indication, they'll keep packing 'em in while nothing else changes.\n",

I don't think I've ever ordered anything but their special garlic chicken ... until my most recent visit.  The waiter highly recommended the ox tail lunch special and I went with his suggestion.  I was so glad I did ... very flavorful and the meat fell right off the bone.  The lunch portion was perfect so it would cause me to fall asleep after consuming so much food.  I'll definitely get the ox tail again.\n",

      "Garlic Buttery Bread to start.  Avocado Salad with red wine vinegar, salt &amp; pepper. Garlic Chicken with black beans, plantains and rice.   I think this would be my \"last meal\" choice if I were on death row. They give you enough chicken to feed a family, though it's so damn tasty that you will be compelled to eat it all. It's so tender it falls right off the bone. The garlic butter sauce is so lovely and probably so bad for you, but I don't care. The plantains....they're PLANTASTY!! Everything is great. The service is ridiculously fast. Sometimes you feel like cattle, but I don't have a problem with that. If you want to have a relationship with your waiter, this is probably not the place for you.   Oh, their Shrimp in Garlic Sauce is also amazing. They give you an obscene amount of decent sized shrimp. Pour the sauce all over your rice. OMG yum! Oh and their steaks are pretty well made too. My sister always gets one.   BTW: beat the crowds because parking can be a bitch. Either do an early or late dinner.\n",

      "There's something that's hard to quantify about Versailles. The food should not be as good as it is. The  Famoso Pollo Versailles, for example, is always way overcooked, but still delicious.  There is something magical about the citrus garlic sauce that they serve with the chicken. Ask for extra!  Last time I went, I got the Macitas de Puerco Fritas and it was terrific. I think it's going to be my new standard from Versailles.  The food isn't fantastic, but it is very good. Given the large quantities and the moderate prices, it's a very good value.  I've been going for years and years and the quality has been consistent.

The tamales were BOMB too, best tamales I've ever had, but I don't eat too many tamales, but it was still freaking good. The pork was so juicy and in huge portions. The calamari steak with garlic sauce was also surprisingly good. The sangria was the second best I've ever had, but to be fair the first was in Spain. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 combos for 3 people and had tons of food left. Cons: Service was slow, I had to ask to order several times, and felt lucky when they refilled my water. The chicken, while tastey, was too dry. The salmon with garlic sauce was just meh.   If I remember correctly, the chicken at their La Cienega location was juicier and the service was a lot better. But the space at this location is bigger and better decorated. All in all a good experience that left me in a slight food coma.\n",

Since the last time I was here, they have painted, which looks better, but I'm here for the food, not the decor.   I changed my mind and got the Roast Pork (Lechon Asado). While eating, the garlic sauce tasted more sour than the last time I had it, but never the less, it was still good. The beans, rice and plantains are always good here. Since I was in the cuban mood, we also ordered Mojitos, but they were really sweet, hummmm. The service was attentive and quick as usual. So, if you are in the mood for some cuban food, stop by.

I personally love the steak (#11 and #12) but I have numerous friends who are in love with their chicken.   If you're ever craving a  delicious flavorful steak with grilled onions  then the bistec de sollomino and bistec de lomo are just for you. They come with black beans, rice and fried plantains on the side. Although I would rather have a double helping of the plantains and forgo the beans, they don't allow any substitutions here.   Also parking is really cramped and large cars smash into compact spaces ALL THE TIME. Sad to say that a few of our cars have suffered minor casualties with a few extra dings and scratches that weren't there pre-dining.  The place is pretty crowded at dinner time, even during the week! Loud rambunctious restaurant which is good for group dinners, just have to wait for a table.  Minus one star for obnoxious creepy wait staff. They blatantly stare at all the girls and make you feel dirty. YUCK. Yum for the food though. Make that YUM YUM for the food. Sigh. My mouth is watering just writing this review.

The oxtail stew is AWESOME, and my friend Jeff always loves (and raves about) the garlic chicken.  The garlic bread they serve is too greasy, but the sangria is damn good.  The fried plantains are nice, but there's too much rice served with everything (I don't love rice, so it's probably just my stupid bias).

I have never really tried authentic Cuban food, but it was definitely worth a try. I got the lechun asado, which is the pork. It comes with plantains, rice and black beans. I loved the beans, so good. Just wish I could have got more. The pork is really good too, nice and moist. Their garlic chicken (chicken #1) is their most popular. It is definitely worth a try.

      "I get a craving for Versailles from time to time, and today was one of those times.  I haven't been to Versailles in about 2 years (there isn't a Versailles where I live now).  I've always loved the atmosphere there.  Family-friendly, casual, and fun.  The servers there are always very friendly and attentive.  They also have a really good sense of humor.  They are always the type to joke around and are very light-hearted.    The first change I noticed today was the prices.  They have gone up.  I am not sure when the prices went up, but it went up quit a bit.  I was a bit surprised.  Despite the rise in prices, the food was as good as usual.  I always order the RABO ENCENDIDO (my favorite Cuban dish) with a refreshing iced cold IRONBEER.    It was as good as I remembered.  The ox tail fell off the bone and the stew was saucy and flavorful.  Perfect to eat with white steamed rice.  I tried some of my sister's Garlic Chicken and that is also just as good as I remembered, too.  Nice and tasty and juicy.  You must be a big fan of garlic to eat that dish, because they do not hold back on the garlic.  Not the kind of dish you would order if you were on date :).    Although the prices have changed, the food quality definitely has not changed.  I would definitely continue to come here for their rabo encendido.  I've been to several Cuban places and Versailles is still my all time favorite Cuban restaurant.  We also used go to the one in Manhanttan Beach, too.  Both provide good quality food.  The parking lot at the Venice location is small and the spaces are tight, so try to carpool or take the smaller car :).\n",

      "Being Dominican/American, and having lived in Humboldt County for the last 7 yrs, I had come to terms with the fact that unless I cooked at home, or went back to the East Coast, I was never to enjoy a good old-fashioned Caribbean meal. That is no longer the case (just moved to LA). YEY!!!  I discovered Versailles through a friend, and was utterly delighted to see that all of the dishes I grew up with (lots of which I don't know how to cook) were offered on the menu.  Can I just say, their Platanos (plantains) are to die for (green or ripe).  I ordered white rice, black beans, lemon-garlic chicken, salad, &amp; green plantanos. The serving was enough food to feed at least three people, needless to say, I had yummy leftovers for the following couple of days.  The price is a bit steep, but I'm willing to splurge now &amp; then for a little taste of home.  I didn't particularly care for the decor, or the table setup, but once my food came, I forgot all about it.   Note: Plantains are to be eaten fresh &amp; warm.

This particular location is always crowded.  A lot of students from UCLA frequent the place for their reasonably priced meals and delicious sangria.    Their specialty is the garlic chicken.  You can order this as half a chicken, or a chicken steak (chicken breast fillet).  The garlic sauce is tangy and it is served with onions on a fluffy bed of white rice.  They also serve plantains and black beans on the side.

We got there a little after 9 p.m., so the place wasn't completely packed, but regardless, it was really loud. It's one thing to have a bustling restaurant, but it's completely different when it's just noise--people yelling to talk to one another, someone working there throwing utensils in the bin after they are dried--it was a little much. Maybe I'm just getting too old...  The food here wasn't particularly great either. I did like the garlicky bread they brought to the table at the beginning. In fact, I ate all of it myself, but the remainder of the meal was lackluster. I ordered the ropa vieja. Good ropa vieja should be extremely tender and flavorful. Versailles ropa vieja was flavorful with lots of tomato and bell pepper, but very chewy. My jaw was literally aching at the end of the meal because the meat was so chewy. I think the rice was a bit on the undercooked side, but the black beans and plantains were fine. In fact, I really liked the plantains, and those were the only thing I managed to finish.  What really capped off my experience here was seeing someone who worked at the restaurant blow their nose and walk back and touch stuff without washing his hands in between. I'm still amazed that I managed to continue eating after seeing that.  If you don't mind really noisy restaurant, and giant portions of mediocre food then this may be your place, otherwise, I'd consider going somewhere else.\n",

The parking lot sucks but what can you do for good food?  I say again order the chicken or the pork and you cant go wrong.  The food is just so damn flavorful.  Of course the menu does state the garlic chicken is great which I have ordered and loved but my garlic favorite is reserved for another garlic hot spot of mine....

Tender chunks of great beef with potatoes, plantanes, and amazinnggg rice. Literally I've taken the rice to go and microwaved it the next day as a snack.  This location generally has a line around dinner time but it goes pretty fast.  The prices are great.  Edit: The service is hit or miss, though it's never been amazing- last night it was TERRIBLE.

The fried plantains are not to be missed, if you don't mind a little grease. The prices are reasonable too.  There is always a wait and the parking is really bad, try across the street for a spot, in one of the side streets. Not a great date place or for large groups as tables are at a premium. Just a good place for a small group of friends to chow down.  Despite this, if you haven't been go!\n",

      "Cuban and Puerto Rican cuisine are very similar. I consider myself somewhat of a born-again Puerto Rican, having lived there for a time during my youth.  With that said, although I am usually loathe to frequent \"chain restaurants\" like Versailles, I think their food is totally authentic and delicious.  And the prices make it a lock.  I wish I could vouch for several items on the menu but I find myself always ordering the same thing:  the garlic chicken breast with onions, rice and beans, and moduros (the sweeter preparation of plantains.)   I have never been disappointed.  If you order the garlic chicken, you should be warned that you may be tasting it for at least 12 - 24 hours after consuming it; which I actually believe might be a good thing.  At least it has staying power.  It's greasy, tangy and delicious... and the portions are impressive.  The atmosphere is boring and similar to a 70s diner but I've never been to an authentic Cuban or Puerto Rican joint with great atmosphere.  (The legendary Metropol in San Juan has a similar look -- and people wear ties and sport jackets there -- so this is the kind of decor I've come to expect from such places.)  Speaking of Diner, last time I was there I saw Daniel Stern (Breaking Away, City Slickers) chowing down. Parking at the Venice spot is weird... the lot is very tiny and there's not a lot of room to maneuver around so carpool if you can.  All in all, great stuff.  Versailles is my number one destination when I'm in the mood for criollas comidas! If you're looking for a NY equivalent, try El Deportivo (9th Ave. at 48th St.) or La Caridad (Broadway at 78th St.).\n",

But that's what makes it good!  The very first time I didn't really care for the garlic chicken because of how sour the sauce was. But after trying it a few times, I converted over to the dark side. I actually get extra sauce. I love their garlic chicken, but the garlic pork is even better. Mouthwatering.  That could be because of how sour it is, but it is really good.  The meat is so moist and full of flavor. Plus you have to try the sangria. Delish!

And a sangria, a mojito and beer.  total was about $20/per person.  The Yucca was ok.  Tasted sort of like a potato.    All of the pork and meat dishes were good.    The halibut was eh.  Once again, I must have ordered wrong.  They serve HELLA greasy bread to start and each meal order comes with white rice, black beans and fried plantains on the side.  The wait was about 15 minutes and the service was fast.  Overall, it was a good meal but nothing to die for -- but it's a decent local favorite if you're going to be in the area.\n",

      "Cuban food is amazing, wish there were more places (Versailles or not) nearer to where I live.   I find myself eating here, or in their other location which I prefer, though they really are very similar. The plus for the Venice location is that it's bigger, more nicely decorated, and has better parking. The plus for La Cienega is that it's closer and the servers tend to be more in tune.  Otherwise though, the servers here have always been nice to us, they aren't great, but never horrible. In fact, my mom tends to be rather annoying about asking for stuff and they are really nice about it.  I have to add that one time I came in with friends not knowing they were about to close (place still had a decent amount of people, but we didn't realize they were mostly finished). They still served us and as the place cleared out didn't even pester us to leave or put up chairs in our section. I hate being \"those people\" who walk in right before closing, but they were surprisingly cool with it.  Everyone on here has probably talked about the garlic chicken. So yeah, get it-- preferably on a first date then you can REALLY test out how understanding he/she is. They give large portions, so I think it's worth what you pay. I always have some left over to box for lunch the next day. I love pouring those black beans over my rice. Mmm...  While I tend to get the juicy, aromatic garlic chicken, I've also had the ropa vieja-- marinade is well-done, beef tender and splits apart nicely.  Chicken tamales are acceptable, I just got that once when I wasn't too hungry eating there with friends... wish I got more than just one tamal for the price though...  The mango milkshake is pretty freaking good too. Super flavorful and creamy, but not too thick, you know? (That's what she said.)  My favorite part is always the plantains. They're done just right and are perfect with your dish.  I've always wanted to try the paella here, but the price turns me off. Maybe one day if I'm with someone who's paying. I'll keep you updated.\n",

      "Should I have read the menu longer before selecting my dishes? My friend heard Versailles had some good Cuban food, so we headed on over to this location since it was only a few blocks from where I was staying. I went with our gut and chose the first thing on the Pork section of the menu because it said \"Cuban style\". Eh... I guess we can't always trust our gut.  Ordered the Lechon Asado (cuban style roast pork) and Yucca Rellena (stuffed yuca). The Yucca Rellena was a little under seasoned, but okay. But the Lechon Asado looked like cat food (shredded meat in liquid) and tasted.... sour. Is that right? Can anyone tell me if this was supposed to taste sour? Someone please let me know! However, we did see a bunch of people ordering what looked like a huge pork leg or piece of chicken. That looked pretty damn good. And there WAS a huge line outside for a seat after we left...  I'm torn on giving this place 1.5 or 2 stars. So I guess 2 stars will have to do until I can get myself to go back.\n",

So far the Arroz con Pollo, Sirloin Steak, and Famoso Pollo were just ok, but maybe i just don't have the tongue for Cuban cuisine.  Aside from that, the main reason it only gets 3 stars is the horrible service. The last time I went, the waiter greeted us with a warm \"what do you want\"? After we were served, we never saw him again, but he was quick to grab the ticket after I left the tip (he got 10%).\n",

The waiters are very accomodating too.   A couple of times I went w/ a group of about 30 people, and despite the chaos, they remained calm and friendly.\n",

I've heard that some locations are better than others, I've heard that it's the greatest Cuban food ever, I've heard it's not so great at all.... I realized it was time to form my own opinion of this place.  A couple of disclaimers: I've only been to the Venice Blvd location and I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, only take-out.   When I think \"take-out,\" I usually think fast food, pizza, Chinese, or Thai. I love all four but if you take out often (as I do), these options get a bit old. So I was very happy to discover that Versailles, just down the street from my apartment, is big in the take-out business (when I go in to pick up my order, there are often just as many people at the takeout counter as there are eating in-house).   Service is always fast.. they usually tell you over the phone that your order will be ready in 10-15 minutes, so as soon as I hang up the phone, I start walking.   I'm a fan of the picadillo.... a hearty, filling stew made with ground beef, potatoes and tomato sauce. Each entree is served with fried plantains, rice and beans,and everything (except a couple of seafood dishes) is priced under $15.   For a fairly inexpensive and flavorful take-out meal, Versailles can't be beat.\n",

All this for $20!! That's right, for two people, it's only going to cost you $20.   You get the most bang for your buck here, I promise.

      "It's a shame that it took me more than 24 years as a Los Angeles native to finally make it over to Versailles Cuban Restaurant.  I'd always heard of it, but never had the opportunity to taste the cuisine of this LA staple.  As my exposure to Cuban food hasn't been too extensive, I cannot claim an expertise on the subject, by any means.    During my first visit to Versailles a few weeks ago with my boss, I ordered the lechon asado- Cuban style roast pork marinated in a garlic mojo criollo sauce, served with black beans, rice, and grilled plantains all for under $8.  Now...Versailles is not about the best presentation or anything, but the main feature is, indeed, the food.  The pork was soooo tender, and the oily, buttery, garlic infused sauce paired with the bitterness of the raw onion and the softness of rice- all of this was pure indulgence for the senses.  The slight acidity of the garlic sauce was countered nicely by the sweet and char of the grilled plantains.    During my last visit to Versailles a few nights ago, I opted for the restaurant's famous dish- the \"famous garlic chicken\"- a roasted half chicken marinated in the garlic sauce ($9.95).  They are not messing around about the portions.  The tender meat was juicy and just slipped off the bone at the touch of the fork.  There was just enough of the garlic sauce to be sopped up by the meat and rice.  Again, how can you not be pleased by grilled plantains.  All of this was washed down with a delicious guanabana (one of my most favorite fruits of all time- white flesh, big black seeds, flavor reminiscent of coconut/berries/pineapple) shake ($3.50).    Affordable.  Down to earth.  Delicious.  Los Angeles. Grand, I tell you.\n",

To reiterate some other reviews, the portions are large and can easily fill you up if you're very hungry.  In terms of the service, our waiter  wasn't exactly the friendly person, but it wasn't awful either.   Lastly, parking can be difficult to find, especially on busy  nights.\n",

However, Versailles does serve a great Arroz con pollo, and that is one of the staple dishes. They do it well. Extremely well. Not to mention their yummy bistec empanizado de pollo (roughly translated: chicken-fried steak chicken). Plantains are my favorite side dish, and the Moro here is as good as it gets.

The plantains and black beans that come with the dish are also of perfect quality (I know this because I was spoiled when I went to the Bay Area and Cuban food there just isn't close to what it is here). The bread they serve with your meal is practically drenched in olive oil, be forewarned.  I recommend having a dish with a Materva, a Cuban soda that tastes kind of like carbonated apple juice with a kick. Definitely adds to the authentic flavor of the place.

I ordered the #13, and I have no idea what the name it was but it was the Ribeye. It was tender juicy and served under french fries. I believe all entrees come with steamed rice, fried bananas, and black beans.  The service was very authentic, i'm confused with the differences between a latino and cuban accents.  I'm rating this restaurant according to the tastiness of the food because I feel I don't have the right to grade it according to the cuban authenticity.\n",

I do recommend their famous Garlic chicken dish, but don't be afraid to try the pork. It's seasoned nicely, melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. I'm not a plantain person, at all. I'm usually the first person to offer my plantains to the table. But something about combining Versaille's plantains with their garlic sauce to make that savory-sweet works for me.   I would give the restaurant 5 stars - but there is one thing holding me back. I can't say that I enjoy their Sangria at all. I get excited to see it on their menu and have been disappointed everytime I order it here. Maybe if they found something other than oranges in season (that's what I seem to get everytime I order it), that might help? Or maybe it's the wine they use? Probably a little from column A and column B. And yet, I continue to order it thinking that this time, could not be any worst than the last one. So sad. Work on your Sangria, Versailles and then we'll talk.   Heads up - they do have a small lot, but it's get's aggressive in there. I usually park on the street and walk over. Also, it's not uncommon to see a line out front. It's a popular place, but don't fret the line moves quickly.\n",

Maybe it's because I've never had true Cuban cuisine, but the liquid sauce was very overwhelming... think Garlic listerine because even after I brushed my teeth I could still smell garlic garlic garlic. The chicken itself was surprisingly moist inside and super crunchy on the outside, though. Around $10 including tax &amp; tip for the dish.  Most dishes come with plantains and beans-- both of which were delicious and a must try. I like to dip my plantains (a kind of banana) into the beans before eating. Not sure if this is the proper way to eat the two, but I found the slight sweetness and savory a good combination.  On the plus side: I accidentally dropped my small coach pouch (with random stuff like eye drops, tissues, etc.) on the floor where we were sitting. The man who was cleaning up my table saw it, ran out the restaurant, and stopped my car so that he could give it back to me. A+\n",

All I do know is that the food that I've order is simply delicious!      I rarely stray from my go-to menu item...the combo plate with the garlic pork and chicken with black beans and fried bananas. When I say \"rarely stray\", I actually mean I never stray. But, when the food is that good, why go with anything different.      I loves me some pork, and this pork in all its greasy garlic goodness is a culinary masterpiece. Especially when you mix it up with a bite of the rice, some beans, the onions, and most importantly the bananas, the result is a Cha Cha Cha of flavor in your mouth.      The chicken can be dry at times, but it never derails the overall experience. It can get crowded at times and noisy, but that only bolsters the claim that this is some damn fine food!\n",

But now I've changed. let me tell you a little secret. ..and the secret is..............#25 Beef Stew For serious the best beef stew ever ! you have to try it !  It comes with the plantains, rice and beans like most of the entrees. yum right? But listen to this here.... this is what you have to do. order a side of the garlic sauce. It's basically the sauce they use on the garlic chicken. it's spicy, garlicky..there's some lemon all up in there. So what you do is spoon a little of the garlic sauce onto your rice. let it soak it up. then put some beans on it. I call it flavor layering...... That with the beef stew,sweet plantains..and sangria.. ack ! it's so good.  Additionally.. last night my friend ordered the avocado salad. which is for you if you love avocado because plainly...that's what it is. just a sliced up avocado with some raw onions. They give you oil and vinegar to dress it. she also had them bring her a plate of lemons to use with the oil and vinegar as a dressing. it tasted awesome !  salty..zesty and creamy...

I always get the same thing, the garlic roasted chicken!   You know something that's funny? I keep reading other reviews on how everyone has leftovers? Leftovers don't exist for me here (or anywhere else.) I always seem to manage to eat the entire dish, beans and 1/2 of the rice, and the plantains. The great thing is we walked it off at the beach a few minutes later!   Service is always super quick and friendly. I've never had to wait, well, maybe once in several years.

My all time favorite thing to get here is the Moros, Platanos Fritos Y Ensalada Verde (beans and rice, plantains, and mixed green salad). The deserts are very good.

The garlicky-lemony marinade is what makes this meal so tasty and I like when the platanos (fried plantains) get all mixed up in it.  If I could go back again, though, I would go for the chunks of pork (I think it's #1 on the current menu), which I tried at least once. I love Mexican carnitas and this shares some of that citrus/pork flavor combination that I love.  I've had their sangria and it was OK. If you have a long drive home, I will caution you on topping a big meal of citrusy/garlicky fiber-filled food with sangria and espresso. Nuff said.

Keep in mind that this chicken is really full of flavor so don't order it if you don't think you can handle all excess of cirtrus, garlic, and onion goodness.  The only downside was that the chicken is for big meat eaters as it is A LOT of meat. Didn't have enough rice and beans in the side and I ended up eating only half of my chicken and bringing the rest home because I couldn't finish it. It did make for some pretty good leftovers though.  Oh and I LOVED the plaintans! I don't even like bananas but these were so tasty! Pretty good quality food for your money, and sometimes I have HUGE cravings for that chicken. Oh man, it's just that good!\n",

      "I come here with some regularity and the pork and garlic chicken is great.  Portions are large, split a chicken and get an extra side of plantains.  Generally fast service and food if they aren't swamped.  I made the mistake today of trying the BBQ chicken... that was a let down.  It was the regular chicken covered in a mediocre Western style BBQ sauce.  I also feel their vegetarian plates are sort of not worth it.  No refills on sodas makes me sad.  Parking is tight, but I've never had a problem finding a spot on the street in front of the place.  There is  also a lot around the side which is easy to miss.\n",

      "I've been going to Versailles for years. My dad, the food critic for the L.A. Weekly for its first decade, turned me on to this place. His glowing review graced the restaurant's walls for many a moon.   I can honestly say that I have eaten dinner at Versailles more than at any other restaurant on earth. Yeah, I now live in the neighborhood, Palms (a district unexpectedly replete with fine, moderately priced restaurants) but when I've resided elsewhere, I've driven here, happily, for the great food and sunny Cuban service.  I'm not really going to wax gastronomic here. You've read all the other reviews and I concur with just about all of them, 4 stars and better. Suffice it to say, the #6 chicken is absolutely amazing. Take a dinner home and you'll have 2 and-a-half dinners or 3 lunches that'll last you half the work week. Of course, you might not want to down this fare if you're trying to impress anyone with your breath - you'll burp skunk for 12 hours - but if minty freshness isn't your stated goal, go for it! The lechon asado, for those of you who eat pork, is straight from pig heaven. Just about everything else served here comes highly recommended. Down it all with a Malta Hatuey and you're stylin' - Cuban style, that is.  William, \"El Jefe\" at Versailles, is a great guy. I've seen him at the Venice shop a few times in recent months and his mood seems to have turned down with the turn down of the economy. People just haven't been showing up as they did in the past. Things, indeed, are tough all over and it's troubling to see the restaurant without its customary line out the door.  I'm sure business will pick up again as people venture out less tentatively in coming months, so here's a gentle reminder to support your local Versailles - whether you're in the city, the valley or down the coast a might - through the lean times.   Skunky breath notwithstanding, you're in for a real treat!\n",

I have to say I left satisfied and completely impressed. Hand Claps to Versailles and My Friend!\n",

I always ask for extra onions and sauce because it's the sauce that gives it that extra sour kick that I love. I would kill for the sauce recipe. I know it's probably a really simple sauce, but it's so yummy! The combination of the slow roasted chicken with crispy skin and vinegary onions makes you wonder how you'll ever enjoy any other type of chicken again!\n",

      "This is my first try of Cuban food and I was pleasantly surprised by what this little place had to offer. I give it 3.5 stars!  I went on wednesday for dinner and although it was a small place, they cleared the tables really fast and we did not have to wait to get a table. I ordered the coconut milkshake and was disappointed. It was too much coconut and not really a lot of milkshake, I felt like I was just drinking coconut pulp for most of it. Then I ordered the lamb for dinner, it came with fried plantains, black beans and rice and it was absolutely delicious. The lamb was fully cooked but still very tender and it retained the sauce very well. The sauce was a little bit spicy, a little sour but very powerful. I could taste the sauce with every bite of lamb and I felt that the two went perfectly together. The rice was good, it was lightly seasoned with salt and lime which I appreciated very much. I like a place that pays attention to small detail, a lot of places neglect the rice so it was nice that this place took the time to lightly season the rice to give it a little extra. The black beans were excellent as well. They were cooked but not all all mushy and they too were lightly seasoned. I think the black beans were actually me favorite part of the dish, along with the rice it was perfection. The plantains were good, what I expected and nothing special or out of the ordinary.  Overall it was good food for fast and good service but not very expensive, I highly recommend this place!\n",

      "This place isn't as generous or friendly as it was before they remodeled and opened more locations around the city. My favorite dish is the garlic chicken with fried plantains, black beans and rice. There used to be an option to order either the quarter chicken or the half, but now they only serve the half, which is pretty huge for one person. You could share the dish with someone else, but they only give you like three fried plantains, and a thin serving of black beans and rice (the best part!), so if I shared it with someone like myself we'd end up fighting over them. Of course Moros is available as an alternative to black beans and rice, but our waitress didn't even ask which we'd like, so we had to tell her (and she seemed annoyed by this). Overall, Versailles is just not as fun as it used to be. It's loud, crowded, and most importantly, stingy with the r,b, &amp; p.  I left unsatisfied and wishing I'd gone to El Rincon Criollo in Culver City, where they always serve equal parts chicken, rice &amp; beans, and plantains.\n",

      "Versailles is an institution, kinda like Tito's Tacos or Roscoes Chicken &amp; Waffles. They make a few things that get the amazing reputation and a bunch of other stuff that nobody ever orders.  The two standouts are the Garlic Chicken and Cuban Roast Pork. Versailles has many other menu items like Lomo Saltado and Oxtail, but most are disappointing and take a lot longer to get out of the kitchen. (Oxtail is indeed a rich and tasty exception.) Skip them for the two standouts above.  Unless it's late in the evening, the chickens are turned out of the kitchen so often that it's rare you'll get an overcooked bird. Usually the chickens are juicy and crunchy-skinned, slathered with garlic sauce and are way too much for one person. Drawback: rice, plantains and beans on the side don't soak up the amazing sauce, so you have to scoop them into the chicken plate yourself. Messy.  The Roast Pork is similar, fork-tender and succulent, garlicky as all get-out, in bed with a huge serving of white rice and plantain slices. Dump in some black beans and you're all set. You'll take half the plate home as leftovers inless your name is Shaq.  Inside tip: they'll offer onions to go with your plate; ask to get them grilled...like In-N-Out, grilled onions give just the right sweetness to balance out that spicy garlic sauce.  The Venice Blvd. location recently got a face-lift of fresh, colorful paint and moldings; it's still not a luxury experience, but Versailles is now a little less dive-y than they used to be.  I go there every month or two, and many times I take out-of-towners for a cheap meal. Most want to return when they come back to town (even if they don't remember the name of the restaurant)...how's that for a testimonial?\n",

I order this with the steamed moist white rice on the side and put the beans over the rice. The one on Venice Blvd is great but I have also been to the other one on La Cienaga near Pico. Not much atmosphere but the delicious food (served fast) is consistently always great. I have never tried any other dishes but the ones above though.\n",

I ditch the beans and order double rice cause the beans don't have any full good flavor like down at El Rincon. It also comes with water bread and fried plantains. If you carry it out get your plantains in a separate box unless you want them smothered in citrus garlic sauce. The plantains do not have as much flavor or caramelization as I would like them to have.  I have also had their cuban sandwhich and its so-so.

The palntains were to die for and turned out to be a great combination to go along with the meat.

It's delicious, simple, Cuban Soul food.  The menu here is actually quite large and includes many daily specials but  for me it was always about the Half Roasted Chicken w/ Barbecue Sauce, Black Beans, Rice &amp; Sweet Plantains. It was a winner everytime.  The Black Beans and Rice with the Sweet Plantains alone are stellar. I'd have this alone everyday for lunch if I could.  Meals here always start with the complimentary garlic bread and food is normally quick to arrive soon thereafter. You definitely won't leave here hungry but you just might need a nap afterwards.  Service is usually stiff but adequate. This place does get very busy but they move tables here quickly which is appreciated when you're on the lunch clock. It's definitely a beehive of activity. Volume here is loud and atmosphere is definitely minimal but the food is very good and once you dig in it's all about what's in front of you.

Still living in Orange County but every time we are up in LA for whatever reason, I make it a point to go to Versailles.  I always get the  #1 - Garlic Chicken (you get literally a HALF chicken) with rice, beans, and fried plantains.  I think they have raised prices since I first went but it is still a gigantic plate of food for under $10.  Like I mentioned before, I could do shots of that tangy garlic sauce, but I also might have a husband that might never want to kiss me again. We've also gone to the one in Manhattan/Redondo.  The parking is defnitely easier at this location and the dining area is a little better.  However, there is nothing pretentious about Versailles, they speak volumes with the taste and quality of their food.  As other reviews might have mentioned, the service is really quick - I usually get my order within five minutes of ordering.  The husband is sometimes adventurous and tries other items - I think he has tried the pork and a couple of other entrees.  I, however, am a creature of habit, and when I find something truly delicious, I usually stick with it.  #1, with extra garlic sauce and an extra order of fried plantains.  Usually have leftovers and yes, it stinks up the car.  Totally worth it!  :)\n",

Sangria - $12 a pitcher (about 6-10 glasses depending on the glass)  vs $2.75 for a small glass.  Definitely do the right thing, por favor.  Bread - golden-buttered goodness - this time we arrived at 10pm and weren't served any.  Usually I could live off of the bread alone.  I tried putting sugar on it once - I recommend it if you're not fat or diabetic.  Plantains - it comes with every pork, chicken and beef.  awesome.  I had some appetizers once upon a time - I can't remember any of them and didn't think that highly of them.  save your money.  The flan's alright, but fake someone's birthday and maybe get it for free/cheaper?  I don't know.  I definitely like my beans and rice in the style of Moro (cristiano y moro), which means they mix the rice and beans together, rather than having to swallow the thick soupy black bean goop.  I recommend coming here after 9pm so you can just sit your ass down upon arrival, instead of waiting forever outside in the cold,  Unless you have a sucker friend who will sit in line for the group.\n",

      "I've been visiting Versailles for years, first when I was still living in Chicago and coming to LA a couple times each year to visit friends, and now more frequently as I live in the SF Bay Area.   I had ALWAYS ordered the garlic chicken (mimicking my friends), but when I visited over this past Memorial Day weekend, I tried the roast pork for the first time.  I have \"seen the light\" and am now completely addicted, and am already looking at cheap airfare so I can (1) eat at Versailles ASAP and (2) visit my friends in LA (in that order).   I should mention that the service here (Venice Blvd. location) is always fantastic.  Drink refills and baskets of garlic bread keep coming, and the plates of food show up on the table much faster than you'd expect (and sadly the experience ends all too quickly!).\n",

      "i've been coming here for years, but my motives for patronizing versailles has changed with time though. when i use to go here as a poor, starving, college student, my main priority was to get the most food for my buck. seriously, ordering the 1/2 order of garlic chicken meant having dinner that night and then leftovers for lunch or dinner the following day. going to versailles was a survival tactic. no joke.   nowadays, i go because it just tastes good! not like i didn't appreciate the flavor before, but having a real job means being able to choose where i want to spend my bucks, so it says a lot that i still come back here time and time again. i really enjoy the buttered bread they serve you at the start of your meal (though they become rocks if you ever have them the following day). the garlic chicken is so freakin' yummy and so is the pork....the plantains, to die for. i use to drive from silverlake JUST to get their plantains. love the way they are so nicely caramelized around the edges. ohhh..and the perfectly made black beans (my stomach is grumbling now from just the description of it) to spoon over my rice. happy stomach!  the only beef i have with versailles nowadays is when i order their garlic chicken for take out, the chicken is usually pretty dry and they don't ladle enough sauce on it. i always ask for a side of the garlic sauce BUT you have to pay extra for it. what the heck? why am i paying extra to make your food jucier?   no matter. i still eat here. my taste buds have fond memories of this place.\n",

      "#10... that's all I need.  Meat.. with a limey sauce... ok.. well it doesn't tame my need for heat but.. that's why they don't get 5 stars.  I tried getting the rib eye once but maybe it was too fatty so it didn't soak up as much as the sourness of the sauce..   I always stick to my #10.  At least I think it's the #10.. the sirloin i think that's what it is.. I haven't been in forever but I have done my share in paying it forward and everyone i've taken has been back several times, even if it wasn't with me.  They sell the their marinade in bottles it's like $3.00.. but it just isn't the same.   The caramelized onions go great with each bite of the meat and then you drizzle the black beans over your rice and then finish it off with some sweet plantains..  Oh don't forget washing it down with some dos equis.   I had the garlic chicken the first time.. it's a good way to introduce the flavors but it's definitely not as good as beef.  I keep trying other things but i usually regret it and wish I had ordered the #10.  I had a bad experience once with the quality of food but I felt so bad because I usually love it but the waiter immediately noticed I wasn't liking it too much and came over and asked if I wanted anything else.  I just got more rice beans and plantains to get through the night.. and it didn't stop me from going back the next day.  Hey guys! add some grilled jalapenos or something to the mix.. it would make me go every day with no hesitation at all.\n",

      "I am giving Versailles 4 stars because of my two favorite dishes--garlic chicken &amp; cuban sandwich.  The only thing I order at Versailles is either of the two choices I previously mentioned.  I have tried other entrees and they are good but not great.  The garlic chicken is definitely worth trying.  The portions are huge, the chicken is moist, and the sauce has an amazing tang to it.  The chicken that they serve for this dish is massive.  I'm not talking about a drum stick and a breast, but half the chicken [at least that's what it seems like].  I usually have leftovers but if I am feeling ambitious I can devour the entire dish.  The chicken is smothered in their garlic butter sauce.  There is a tangy-ness to the sauce which I love--I can't put my finger on what the ingredient is though.  White onions lay atop the chicken, and the chicken lays upon a bed of rice.  The dish comes with their black beans &amp; garlic/butter bread.  I loooove these sides.  I like to dip my bread in the black beans and eat it after every bite of chicken.  All the flavors merry very well on my palate.  I highly suggest this technique =]  I haven't tried any other Cuban sandwich mainly because I am having a hard time finding a restaurant that serves this item.  But the cuban sandwich at Versailles is addicting.  It comes with smoked ham, roasted pork, swiss cheese, sweet pickles, and mustard on cuban bread.  The entire sandwich is then grilled. This sandwich sounds simple but it packs a lot of flavor.  It is served with a side of french fries which is also essential when eating a sandwich like this one.    As you can see, I frequent this restaurant often.  If you are curious as to what Cuban food is all about, Versailles is definitely the place you want to be.\n",

      "we've been driving by versailles on cienega for years and we were going to try it last month but we ended up at lalas grill instead. when looking at what to order there was more than a few things i would've been happy with but my mind was set on the oxtail stew since i've been jilted twice ordering it from two different jamaican restaurants. in fact when we sat i wondered what are the chances that they run out of it for an early sunday night service. sure enough when it was my turn to order the waiter said \"im sorry we ran out about 1/2 an hour ago. doh! why-why-why-why me, all i want is a simple ox tail stew.   the wife offered to go to the cienega location or to call first before we go, but i was starving and its been 9hrs since we last ate an early lunch in chinatown. i ended up with the bistec de palomilla and it wasn't a bad choice since i haven't had it in a long time but all i could do before the food came was think about the oxtail. by the time the food arrived the stew was forgotten cause the bistec smelled fantastic. the sauteed onions was cooked perfectly, sometimes certain places like this the onions can still be a little raw but in this case it wasn't. the smell of the lime and parsely on the beef was killer and i couldn't wait for a bite but i had to douse the rice with the beans and mix it until there was hardly any white left on the rice. when i took the first bite of the bistec it was super good, it was a little better than moms which hers can be a little acidic (sorry mom). when eating bistec i've always had a routine, cut the beef and onions into bite size pieces where the beef is slightly larger than the onions, take the forkful bite and skate it on the gravy/au-jus, then take a bite and when the bite is done follow it up with the rice for a pallate cleanser. makes me hungry just thinking about it. when i was done i didn't feel so bad they didn't have what i intially wanted.   wife ordered the camarones al ajillo (shrimp scampi) and it was super pungent in a good way. there was a lot of garlic and butter in that dish because when i was done with mine, i was taking their bread and was soaking it in that sauce. slightly expensive dish knowing how much it cost to make shrimp scampi from scratch but they do give you 7-8 pieces of jumbo butterfly shrimp.      if you like flavors in your dish and could care less how it looks which is my style of food. then you will absolutely love versailles. we will surely be back again which is hard to do in LA because there's so many great eats to try.\n",

Letitia W. got the salmon. My fish came with the usual plantains and rice and beans.   I salivated while i waited for my hunk of garlicky goodness. and when it arrived, i inhaled the delicious fumes, and dug into the center. the meat melted in my mouth while the sting of their famous, citrusy garlic sauce spread across my tongue. i quickly poured my black beans all over the delicate white rice, and then poured a second helping of Letitia W's on mine (hey, i asked! ).... and started cramming, fish, rice/beans, into my mouth simultaneously. paired with a class of Chardonnay, my belly rejoiced. afterwards, i gave into the hunks of bread soaking in their garlic fatness, while dipping it into my remaining black beans. yeah. i'm a glutton for punishment. but at least i can admit it.   bless you versailles.\n",

There was a line on a Friday night, no list, just a line...I tried the famous half chicken, which came with a side of rice, black beans and fried bananas. The half chicken was HUGE. Flavoring was good, got a little dry once I ate all the dark meat and got into the white meat. Flan for dessert...too thick with a cinnamon-y touch, not used to that. Def. a place to try, but wouldn't work well with my pocket book on regular basis. $22 for paella is not my style.\n",

The interior is bustling and cheerful, and there are plenty of yuppies mixed in with the down-home ethnic crowd.  Staff are very friendly and welcoming. The garlic chicken will leave your breath roaring for the next 24 hours, but it's worth it even if you have a hot date.  I would recommend splitting the #6 garlic chicken in fact - it's a half chicken or perhaps even 3/4, it's a LOT of bird.  Beef stew was meltingly tenderly good.  Cubano sandwich was not the best I've had, the meat filling was very ordinary.  The alcohol selection is lacking, but stick with water - it'll leave more room in your tummy for the great food!\n",

I especially enjoy mixing my beans and rice with a gluttonous amount of Tapatio and eating it with my oxtails. My friend Lee and I went one night for a simple dinner and sat there slurping away at our delicious oxtail bones - while the couple next to us were enjoying a first, maybe second, date.

Two of my veggiesaurus sisters order the only two veggie options on the menu (bananas and salad?) and my fellow meatasaurus orders up the 1/2 pollo en salsa barbacoa (Sweet n Juicy roasted half chicken with BBQ!) and I opt for the Pan con Lechon Samich (Shredded Roasty Pork on Cuban Bread with grilled onions!)  Now...Dudes....i kid you not....I hardly nibble on some yucca and sip on my brew when in mere minutes ALL of our food is upon us!  Our humble clan is all near starvation thanks to MAPQUEST(BOO!)....and we all happily dig in! The roast pork is too much.....too much good stuff....think carnitas torta... cuban style....magnifique!

I am not a fan of plantains or of sweets/fruit items mixed in with dinner, but their fried plantains were amazing and disappeared with the rest of my dinner. Their yellow rice is tasty, and even the black bean cup was scrumptious. The only reason they got 4 stars was because our waiter was lametastic, had to ask for things multiple times, didn't speak English, and just didn't care to do his job well.

(The benefits of being a third wheel...)  During my visit, I ordered the garlic battered halibut. The halibut itself was quite tasty, however I was not so big on the sides that came with the meal. Maybe this is just an intrinsic Asian bias but i prefer plain old steamed rice to accompany an otherwise salty entree. The beans weren't really anything to write home about.  Although the plantains helped balance out the overall meal, I'm not quite sure what the big fuss is about. Describing them as orgasmic passes into the realm of hyperbole. If you don't like bananas all that much, I honestly don't think frying them is going to change your mind. They seem more like a novelty food than anything else.

      "Q.  What are you not going to find a lot of dining in this restaurant (and the other links in the Versailles chain)?  A. Cubans.  If you believe that this restaurant is authentic Cuban food ... then you haven't ever really dined on good Cuban food.  There are several Cuban restaurants scattered throughout the Los Angeles County area.  Those of you whose only experience with Cuban food is what you get from Versailles are sorely in need of an eye-opener.  Versailles has a grilled chicken breast 'steak' that's not as loaded with salt as most of everything else on the menu (the sodium-crazy 'lechon asado' holds first place on that list) and any beef steak dish I've tried has featured a thin, tough and dry meat; but Versailles on Venice has become popular because it's on the Westside of Los Angeles.  I could not post this opinion without clicking on a rating star, so I gave it one star.  However, if there was such a rating as a MINUS-star, that's what I would have given it.  P.S. I noticed in some comments on the Versailles chain that  its French name was a puzzle in relation to the cuisine.  For those of you who are not familiar with things Cuban, the \"Versailles\" title refers to a pre-Castro landmark in Habana.\n",

      "First off, I am Cuban-American. Second, I am from Miami and still visit frequently. These things considered, I believe I can give a solid review here. I eat at Versaille's locations several times per year, and not more, simply because I don't have a location near me. IMHO, Versailles is the best Cuban restaurant I have ever eaten at! Whoever the little old lady is that created their marinates and sauces is a saint.  However, just like with most restaurants, I believe you have to know what to order to get the great experience. The things I order frequently are the Pork Chunks(masa de puerco), Roast Pork(lechon or puerco asado), Oxtails(rabo), Garlic Chicken, and Chicken and Rice.  I have listed these in order of preference. Those are basics in Cuban cuisine and I would stick to those.  There is no place that serves better pork than Versaille's on this planet.  Unless you don't eat pork, you must order it here before any other protein.  The sides are good, but not as good as the mains.  Black beans and white rice, moros(mixed black beans and rice), and the fried plantains are all very good, but I have had better, especially at home.  You won't be disappointed if you order right here.  If you don't like the food here, you don't like Cuban food!\n",

I just don't like Versaille. For Cuban food, I go to Havana Mania in Inglewood. Now that stuff is GOOD. I don't understand why I've had such bad experiences with Versaille when everyone loves it. Maybe it's the only Cuban place that people know of. I don't know. But if you're ever picking someone up at the airport or something, drive a few more exits down and hit up Havana Mania.

      "i just noticed i give 4 stars to most things... but i can't help how i feel.  the first time i've been here was 4 years ago. i thought the chicken was wholly unimpressive. i wasn't old enough to drink yet, so i just took sips from my date's glass. the plantains were delicious.  fast forward to now. every time i come here, and it's usually during lunch, i have no trouble finding parking. when we walk in, there are always too many waiters versus the number of patrons. we are always seated promptly. and for the price of the lunch special (around $2 less than dinner menu?) you get a hearty meal that will keep you full for hours and hours.   i know i thought the chicken was unimpressive years ago. but who knew that those if you eat the chicken+onion+bean+rice all in one big bite, that it's so yummy?? now, this isn't the type of place i'd called a \"culinary delight\". this is the type of food i get when i'm craving a good mix of protein, carbs and sangria. it just tastes like good  home cookin'.  once, a coworker ordered the calamari steak here. it was like a flat piece of squid. and he had fries instead of plantains. needless to say his meal was less than desirable because we all know that the FRIED PLANTAINS ARE SO GOOD! cuban squid steak is just weird.  oxtail stew is yummy, i usually get that when i don't feel like taking apart half a chicken. the bf likes the yellow rice chicken dish. get a pitcher of sangria, it makes the meal so much better when everyone is a little buzzed off this red nectar.  oh, and the buttery crisp bread they serve at the beginning is good too.\n",

Everything was fine when we were seated but then it was crap from there. We placed our order including drinks. We ended up getting our food before the drinks so we asked for them again. It was just a Coke and a water, nothing difficult. However, we had to ask twice for the drinks. A little aggravating. Then the side of rice was cold. Not lukewarm, straight from the fridge cold. Clearly we ask for a replacement. The first waiter acts like he doesn't understand the request. He gets another guy  to come and figure out what the problem is. My boyfriend has to tell him in Spanish what the deal is. OK, I'm sorry, how hard is it to figure out that the rice is cold and we want another? Really? From then on the service was terrible. We ate to the sound of the bored waitstaff (it was slow) cursing in Spanish the entire time and then having the waitress practically chuck the check at us. No one came by to check if we needed drink refills, they took condiments off our table while we sitting there and in general it was an altogether rude and unpleasant dining experience from the multiple people that served us (was everyone taking a turn?)  Now, I still like the food but for shitty service like this and for the price (which isn't exactly dirt cheap), it's not worth the trouble. Step up Versailles, you're not that awesome that we can't go somewhere more pleasant for Cuban food.\n",

Pillowy and sweet plantains accompany your garlicky-lemony-awesome falling off of the bone pork.  If you like beans (my stomach detests them, so I can't vouch for beans) their black bean sauce smells smokey to go over the tender rice.  I am giving this a 5 because Versailles is NOT pretentious, is NOT a scene and is very comfortable and has great food with decor being second to the food.  You gotta try it.  I know this is their 1,000th review, or so but I am sending high accolades to this Cuban star of delish.\n",

      "I put off trying this place, even though my hunny kept offering to take me. \"Cuban? Meh.\"  I had been to Madres, and I've always been a little turned off by rice and beans. Especially in a resturaunt.  Why would I go out and pay a 300% markup for poor people food? Add fried bananas, and I just really would rather not. I eventually gave in though :\"they have sangria and mojitos? Why did'cha say so before?\" So there we were, squeezing into a parking spot -the lot is inadequate, like everything transportation related in West LA.  I saw why when we went in. The place is brightly -obnoxiously painted, loud, full of happy, portly, down-home customers, and buzzing with literally dozens of waiters and bussers.  It feels like a circus tent -fun. But to the food.   In my experience, garlic and butter can make anything wonderful, and that's the common thread in most of the dishes I've tried here. Actually,  the dishes are almost all prepared  the same way, just different meat. The waiters are friendly and effiicent -they immediately drop a basket of sliced bread that has been :-] drizzled with garlic and butter :-] I think maybe they don't speak English, but that's ok with us. We always get what we came for. I like to watch all the mountains of food coming out of the kitchen. It ALL looks wonderful, and people look so happy when that big ol plate is plunked down in front of them. Seriously. They just light up.  The only thing that dissapointed me once was a salad I ordered. I like my salad, somethimes I just need one before my meal. It was really small and not treally what I consider a salad. I think it was more like half an avodado, a few slices of tomato, and a few rings of that white onion that's on everything else. It wasn't bad -just different. However:   You CANNOT go wrong with their signature chicken dish.   Its 1/2 chicken (I think rotisseried) smothered with this lemony -garlicy-buttery juice -and then scattered with sliced raw onions. I know it sounds harsh, but it actually works. On the side you get a little dish of black beans, which are actually quite well spiced and lovely, plantains -(whatever, I'm not a fan of those, but I'll eat them here) and white rice -which I would  usually abrupty push away were it not for all that sauce spilling over on it. It takes on a whole new meaning. I often get the calamari steak and eat the whole thing but bring home the rice to have for lunch the next day. It is so freaking satifying.   Try Versailles. Its so good and  simple. Do you want sangria? Do you want butter and garlic? Of course. Now all you have to decide is whether you want pork, chicken, beef or seafood with it. Try not to eat too much bread before your food shows up.\n",

      "This place deserves 4 stars for surpassing my expectations, but the lack of ambiance and the fact that you wait in line instead of putting your name down for a table are sort of big turn-offs. But with that being said, the food was excellent and portions were huge. I ordered the bbq chicken and was rather impressed by it. I admit I wasn't quite adventurous enough to try something truly Cuban, but the chicken was great. It was literally half a chicken and came with heaping amounts of rice, beans, and plantains. (The leftovers I ate the next day for lunch were also wonderful). Our food was delivered only minutes after we ordered, and the service was overall more than satisfactory. If it weren't for the place feeling like a giant cafeteria, I'd probably go back more often. Definitely a place to check out- just be prepared to wait in line... which apparently means people like it!\n",

      "Versailles is everything I could want in comfort food. It's delicious, plentiful, affordable, doesn't look too pretty on a plate, and makes you stinky afterward. I arrived in the mood for a paella, but was a little sad to read that it takes 45 minutes to prepare. So instead I opted for the squid and rice, which is described on the menu as \"squid in black ink cooked with white rice and embraced with other herbs and spices.\" And that's exactly what it was. The squid ink kind of seeps in and bonds the rice, forming an almost paella-like black mass. Score. My craving was satisfied, and I liked the dish so much I was already looking forward to eating the leftovers. I also had an eye on my friend's roast pork, which was so tender and zesty that it really makes the case for pork overtaking chicken as the best white meat around.\n",

The food here is satisfying, filling, tasty, and memorable.  I typically order the same items: 1/4 chicken with two sides and black beans. One time I tried the salmon which was quite good, grilled, and served with sides of lemon. The chicken is succulent, and the garlic sauce works well with it along. It's garlicky, tangy, and flavorful. My preferred two sides (generous amounts) are the rice and plantains. So what if it's two starches, I'm just a starch kind of person. It's great that the food arrives quickly soon after placing your order.  Food is always hot too. In terms of seating and wait time, it depends upon what time of day you arrive. I've gone there during rush hour and I've never waited more than 10 minutes. There are a lot of tables, and the turnover is pretty quick.  I come here anytime I'm in the area.  I prefer to go here at lunch because I can have leftovers for dinner.   Food servers are very busy yet are polite, courteous, and efficient.  The price has gone up over the years but that's understandable.  However I don't think it should cost more than $7.  Perhaps they should make the black beans optional to cut down on price.\n",

I've eaten there since I was in high school...let's just say it's been a long time, so I don't feel so old.  Anyway, I've even been to the one in Manhattan Beach, which is not that great and the one on La Cienega. You find yourself craving their food. The garlic sauce, the plantains, beans and rice and all. I think the last time I was there was a couple of months ago but I went for my fix the other night and there were so many changes they made. They have nice new menus now...they got smaller plates to make their portions look bigger or the portions already got smaller. Maybe they are trying to slowly transition to smaller portions. First smaller plates, then smaller portions. It's not the portions that bothered me that much because I believe we all need to eat less. But we always ordered a pitcher of Sangria. And the pitchers were always in those plastic clear huge pitcher thingys. So, this time, the pitcher comes out in a small caraft. We asked the waiter, \"we wanted the pitcher not this\" and he replied \"this is the liter size\" we say \"we ordered the pitcher?\" and he says, \"oh, you don't want the pitcher, it's $60\" But he said it with a heavy accent and we were really confused...so.... Our response, \" Whaaaa? Six - Zero? or One Six?\" He said \"Six - Zero\".  We were glad he clarified that. Whoa, they took away the amount of alcohol and charge more. I didn't mind the portion size of the food but the portion size and price of the Sangria had me in fight mode. $60 bucks for a pitcher of Sangria. It used to be $17 -$19 bucks...I don't remember how much exactly...I just know it used to be under $20 bucks for a pitcher. Who would pay that? That's like a nice bottle of wine at a fancy schmancy restaurant.  I never thought to write a review for this place cause I always eat there and I neglect to write reviews for places I have been eating at for a long time(bad yelper i am)...but I felt like I had to let ya'll know what the 411 was on the Sangria.  The food is not always consistent. Sometimes you have a great meal and sometimes, it's meh....it's definitely worth a try just to see if you like it. Just don't get the $60 Sangria Pitcher.\n",

Slather on some mojo and I'm set.   It was really easy to find, big painted Versailles is clearly visible on Venice Blvd. The parking lot on the other hand, narrow and full. Was expecting a long wait and slow service. Au contraire. We were seated immediately, and service was just as quick to please. Matervas all around, sampler platter and then the platano platter. Oh boy, were we in heaven. A little bit of everything: un papa rellena, yuca frita (regular and stuffed; woah stuffed so goooooood),  tamal, croquettas and delicous chunks of fried pork. Fried plantains stuffed with lechon asado and ropa vieja. I love fried yuca, sooooooooo much. I was stuffed after the appetizers. For the main I ordered the combinacion pollo y puerco. Oh my. I could be nothing but happy at a place which can give me such moist pork and such succulent chicken. And since there was a battle going on in my belly and on my plate I couldn't help but get some more mojo on the side to make everything all wet.  For dessert I had the arroz con leche. So bad for me but soooooooo good. Topped it off with an espresso.  Delightful. Must go back, very soon.\n",

There are a few others, but this is my favorite location. It's just not the same elsewhere. The parking is a little tough, but the food and experience will more than cover for it. Clear winner here.

ONly one way in and one way out.. and the spaces are super small.  My friends and I were seated right away and got complementary bread with butter. I thought it was  pretty good, though the bread tasted particulalry dry that evening.  We ordered: - Lechon Asado - Garlic Chicken and pork combo - the #6; forget what it's called, but it was like half a rotisserie chicken  Sides come with plantains and moro or rice w/beans. I thought the plantains were really delicious. The moro tasted great since it had the beans already mixed in with the rice, however the chicken was a bit dry for me. The portion sizes are huge! I never finished my #6 plate because of all the protein and carbs. When I saw the raw onions I was hesitant about eating them, but after taking a few bites, I found that the lime/lemon marinade tamed the strong taste of the onions  For dessert, we got the tres leches...it was rather on the dry side and tasted more like cake than tres leches. I've had better at Portos and at the Kogi truck.  The service was ok, most of the time our waiter was never there..and other times we'd be calling on another waiter. They never really checked to see if were ok and it was sorta weird because the waiter never smiled or anything when he was pouring our water or bringing food. We found it kind of stand-offish..

      "KC was having the type of morning where he'd crawl up a pig's ass for a pork sandwich. And if you've ever had a truly great Cuban sandwich, you'd know that it's second only to an eastern Carolina pulled pork sandwich in the battle for Earl's greatest honor.  Versailles looks the part. Hell...with all these great reviews, a storied history and servers bouncing around in guayaberas, KC was hyped to sink his fangs into glory. The Cuban at Versailles set KC back ten bucks which was especially lame because ya gotta drop an addition dollar for cheese which is plain silly. Everybody knows a Cuban features roasted pork, ham, pickles, mustard and swiss cheese. Without the swiss, this thing was just a Haitian.  Took the Cuban to-go since KC likes to eat in the convertible. Paying the server was a bit of an adventure since he skipped the whole cash register formality and just made change out of his wallet. Interesting move.  Back at the car, KC flipped open the Styrofoam container to reveal....french fries and no Cuban bread. Damn. This was gonna be an uphill battle. While they didn't make the fatal error of a baguette, the french bread just isn't cool. And what's up with no plantains? Weird. Anywho...check the photo.  http://www.yelp.com/bi...   Normally, KC would give a performance such as this one star. Check out this photo to see what this thing looked like under the hood.  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  Not good. Fortunately, this Yelper was starving and in desperate need of a break from his Asian diet so Versailles gets a second star. KC actually ate the whole thing...even the Styrofoam container (it needed salt).  A connoisseur of Cuban sandwiches from my time in Cuba and the eastern seaboard of the U.S., KC will now let you in on L.A.'s best Cuban sandwiches.   1.) Tropi-Cuba in Torrance 2.) La Caridad in LA (2137 West Temple)  KC won't be returning to Versailles.\n",

I would definitely come back here to try different dishes. As for the dessert we had rice pudding, chocolate flan, and regular flan. I didn't really like any of their dessert, it was way too sweet for my taste bud and did not like the texture of the chocolate and regular flan (Doesn't mean the dessert was bad....just wasn't what I was used too).

First of all, contrary to some of the previous reviews, this location doesn't always take reservations.  I had called in earlier in the day and they said first come first serve.  Not sure if the other locations take reservations or not though.  When I got a table for me and 2 other people, I ended up waiting for my other friends for about 20 min.  My waiter came up to me 3 times asking if my party was still coming, and giving me that look of \"you've been stood up, leave and give the table to someone else.\"  I would have been happy to order a pitcher of sangria and appetizer to, well I guess keep my spot, however I couldn't get a word since he would walk real fast near me with his snide looks.  Even after I had proven him wrong that I wasn't stood up when my friends showed up, he was not very friendly, never refilling our drinks, never came back to see how the food was, and just kind of threw the to go boxes we had asked for.  I'm sure this is not a reflection of their staff, but I was indeed shocked by this person's service.    (PS I totally agree with the previous reviews with the Garlic chicken sort of tasting like Adobo..couldn't imagine it at first, but sure enough, yelp reviews are correct!)\n",

      "Really good Cuban food!   I think everyone knows how great this place is, but I'll give a review anyway.   I met a friend here for lunch. It was packed as always. Luckily my friend was there before and had a table already. They start you off with garlic bread, which I don't believe is traditional Cuban cuisine, but nevertheless is very good! I decided on the Garlic Chicken ($9.95). It's their most famous dish. It's their house specialty-juicy roasted half chicken marinated in delicious garlic sauce garnished with sliced white onions. AMAZING! Highly recommended...\n",

      "Cuban Restaurant that's walking distance from our apartment --- literally walking distance. How lucky we are. This garlic chicken is one of the house special and fave. Its not that its my fave (it became to be) its just that I am not sure what else is good to order. I didn't want to take the risk. The first time I went, I messed up the order, I mean I didn't like what I ordered.  Today, the waiter cheated on our bill. First time that happened. We gave him $100 bill and the change was short $3 and he returned the change without the money holder which I think its kinda rude (he even counted the change in front of us) and unprofessional. Usually my boyfriend is a good tipper 20% of the total bill, but we felt cheated so we left $3 or to think about it $1 is enough for doing such a bad thing.  Food is good though...\n",

      "Best Cuban restaurant I've been to in California.    Is that saying much?  ...somewhat.  Growing up in North Jersey, I'm used to great Cuban food.  West New York and Union City is where it's at when you want authentic Cuban.  And Versailles could definitely hold its own.  I came here with my GF for an impromptu lunch.  She's half Cuban, which means that Cuban food is back on the radar.  Versailles did not disappoint.    We were seated immediately, and when I say immediately I mean that the front door was still closing shut by the time we were sat at a table (AMAZING!).  Bread was then delivered to the table, not authentic Cuban bread, but still tasty.  My GF orders the Arroz con Pollo, upon my urging, and I go with the Bistec De Palomilla.  I just finished eating my second piece of bread when the food arrives at the table.  We're talking about 8-10 minutes here folks.  We weren't in the restaurant for 15 minutes and we were already stuffing our faces.  THAT IS EFFICIENCY!!!!!  The bistec...REDIC!!!  This dish rivals Pan Con Todo in Union City, NJ.  The level of acidity is perfect as is the amount of onions.  A big scoop of rice, several plantains, and a cup of black beans round out the meal.  I was loving every bite.  The Arroz con Pollo was ok, but I wouldn't recommend.  For my money, nothing beats Puerto Rican-style Arroz con Pollo, but I was hoping that it would be better than it was.  I didn't taste enough saffron, and that's so important when it comes to this dish.  The chicken was very tender however.  This is a destination restaurant for sure.  Please plan your day accordingly...\n",

      "My first visit to Versailles and I had to try their signature Garlic Lemon chicken.  Goddamn it was good.  I'll elaborate more when the words come to me.  Tried the pork tamale which was also good, but a little different from the mexican varietes which I'm used to.  A bit greasier than I'm accustomed to.  Parking is located in a private lot and prices are reasonable.  The interior of the restaurant has that 'Friendly's' type family dining atmosphere.    Mmm, still thinking about the garlic.\n",

      "Been here a few times with family and with friends. Came back here today for an early dinner with my lion dance team since we were in the area. Versailles is a place for a large crowd and generally very welcoming too!  At Versailles, I've tried their Famoso Pollo Versailles (their roasted garlic chicken), Arroz Com Pollo, Ropa Vieja and Lengua Guisada (Stewed Beef Tongue). Today, I was adventurous and ordered the Chilindron De Cordero (Sauteed Lamb simmered in a ripe tomato and wine sauce, herbs and spices) along with a Batido de Mamey (Mamey Milkshake).   This place is absolutely delicious! It reminded me a bit of my mom's Cuban home cooking. The savory flavors of simmered tomatoes with wine and marinated lamb tingling my taste buds; deliciouso! My meal came with white rice, bean soup and a side of sweet platanos. What a great way to finish a meal right?!   The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. The restrooms here were decent looking: non sticky floors and no odor of urine unlike some other places I've been to, not mentioning names haha Definitely a place worth coming back to in the future.\n",

      "Muisa Broso!    Versailles has been an icon restaurant in Los Angeles for over 25 years!  Their food is always consistent and delicious!  I always order the roasted garlic chicken.  It is a very crispy on the outside, tender on the inside roasted chicken marinated in a kind of citrus, garlic, and onion sauce.  It's served with raw onions, a spoon full of roasted plantains, white rice and black beans!   The portions are HUGE (each order is a 1/2 chicken) and there is always plenty to take home for a second meal!  My other favorites here are the avacado/onion salad drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, the pulled pork, and just about ANYTHING on the menu!  This restaurant has yummy milk shakes as well - mango, coconut, etc.  My favorite is the coconut milkshake (Versailles brings the boys to the backyard with its milkshakes!).  It's made with real coconut chunks and milk.  Not good for the diet, but absolutely delicious for the soul!  Service here is FAST.  You'll get your food within 10 minutes of placing your order!  Staff are friendly and always standing by to help out!   Both restaurants on La Cienega and Venice serve up consistent and finger licking foods!  I've been a fan for over 25 years!   LOVE IT!\n",

      "I ate here a while back when it was a rainy day. I did order the garlic chicken because everyone said it was delicious but I have a hard time giving a 5 rating for chicken to any place other than Costco's rotisserie that you can buy for $5. Other than that I also find it difficult to give a great rating for rice and beans...etc. I have had better plantains in PR and Miami though.  This place is quite large and they can accommodate large parties if decided. When we were here there was a birthday party at another table so they turned off the lights real quick, lit some candles and sang happy birthday which was pretty old school and I loved that.  Portions will fill you up so be careful what you order and don't order on an empty stomach. I tend to do that a lot then I overeat.  This may be the best Cuban food in LA but I still have a hard time giving them a 4 or 5 rating since I've had better in Miami.\n",

One order is more than enough to feed us (with a few scraps going to our very eager cat). The chicken is deliciously marinated in garlic with a tangy twist of lemon, perfect over rice! The plantains have an amazing texture and sweetness; they just never give us quite enough! (Literally though, last time our \"side\" was four measly pieces. Sad times.)  One day I will eat here but until then, I'll continue bringing home the chicken so I can eat it over the sink with my bare hands like an animal (Big Bang Theory anyone?).\n",

      "Versailles always brings back fond memories of times at UCLA. Sighh...it had been too long since I last came here so me and the bf decided to go this past Friday night. Prices have definitely gone up (I haven't been back in a few years though lol) but the food is exactly how I remembered.  They start your meal with a basket of bread. Lightly toasted with lots of oil. It was alright, but don't fill up on that because their entrees are delicious!  Bf got their famous garlic chicken ($11.99) and I got the arroz con pollo ($10.99). Comes with black beans and plantains. Soo good! Both dishes were extremely flavorful and I'm a huge fan of their black beans. Portions are very generous as well. I wanted to finish mine, but couldn't eat more than half of it.  Versailles can get pretty packed, making parking kind of a pain since their lot is really small. You can probably try your luck on the neighboring streets. They have another location on La Cienega, but I think their parking lot is even smaller. Plus the location itself is smaller but from what I remember, the quality of food and service is the same. Overall, I'm a fan and will definitely be back!\n",

      "I've heard so much about this place from others in the area. On my recent trip to Los Angeles, our family dined here. I was so excited to try their food because here in the Bay, we lack in any cuban and puerto rican food.  Our server was attentive and pleasurable. I felt like he did his best to accomadate everyone in our table. Our food came out in a perfect amount of time.  I have to say that bread and butter they give you in the basket is delicious. I had to stop myself from eating it all. We had the Sangria (which was very good) but I tend not to have more than one cup of sangria (i'm not the biggest fan of it) For appetizers, I had the spinach and cheese empanadas. They were delicious as well as the Papas Rellenas, which were so yuummy but beware of all that fried-goodness!! it will have you slacking later in the day.  For the main course I had: Combinacion Pollo y Puerco. The chicken was tender and cooked to a perfect taste. I must say that the garlic part of the meal seemed like \"vinegar\" it wasn't the best sauce it was drenched all over the meat. If i ever order again it would be without the sauce. it was just too potent for me. However, I loooooved the rice and beans. I mean these were so great.   Overall, I'd go back and try more plates.\n",

Sixth visit: Me - \"So you cook plantains in oil right? Not butter?\" Him - \"Oil\" Me - \"It's odd, my stomach gets pissed off when I eat at Versailles and I don't know what it is. The rest of the food couldn't have any butter in it and I've been told three times now there is no butter in the plantains. My stomach is upset like I accidentally ate something off. Hmmm...\" Him - \"There is some butter with the oil. Is ok?\"  No. Is not ok.  The avocado side salad is tasty. The vegetarian plates are aigh't, nothing to rave about. I'd have said three stars just based on a functional meal option for vegetarians but now that I know they've fed me jacked up butter plantains time and time again, even with me asking three times, I'm gonna have to pass even though I work two blocks away. If it's just a little butter added to the oil, why add it at all?  Not cool. If someone asks if a dish contains butter, or anything else for that matter, to answer \"a little\" or \"some\" is the equivalent of \"yes\". Please pass that along to your staff.\n",

I'm not a big fan of raw onions, but if you chop up the onions and mix it with the chicken, then it's Oh So Good with the black beans! The portions are pretty hefty and I would recommend sharing. Also, if you don't want your plantains mixed with your garlic chicken sauce, simply ask for them to be on a separate plate.   I'm also a fan of the Sandwich Cubano. Mmmm.

Newman own's dressing.. very average.  Dinner 1: Pork #1  - It's some sort of a shredded pork cooked in a sour (ish) sauce... rice on the side. half a raw onion on top* yes, I put it away quietly. It's tasty when you mix it with black beans.  Dinner 2: Chicken #6 - It's a garlic fried chicken... another half a raw onion on top* Nothing special.. some sweet tasting sauce going on there.   This is a good change of pace from my usual Thai food and udon noodles routine. I felt like I need to go back for the Paella on another day because it needs 45 mins advance ordering. I'll invite a few additional friends to share the adventure.  Good price, decent food is what I would call this. Happy New Year!\n",

Ordered the roasted pork (#1), and it was good--tender, nice garlicky flavor with onions, white rice, fried sweet plantains---yummm--and side of tasty black beans. My husband ordered the fried halibut, garlic-butter sauce. He is a vegetarian that eats fish or seafood every great once in a while, so I know the fish is good when he raves about it. Plenty of food, big portions. I will definitely be ordering the garlic chicken next time based on how much I saw it being ordered at the tables around me and reviews on here. I had a mojito and he had a sangria--we both liked the mojito a little better, about $4 for each. Good prices too---looking at the lunch menu prices----would be a steal considering the quality and if portions are similar size. Our waiter was in a hurry and talked to us in Spanish the whole time even though we are not Spanish-speakers, but our Spanglish seemed to work just fine. Skip the bread or take a couple nibbles---it's okay, no big deal and not worth getting full on. Bottom line: Famous and well-rated for good reasons----tasty, decent portions---yummy Cuban comfort food basically.\n",

      "if you like garlic, you will love versailles.  i've tried several things on their menu, and always go back to any of the options that come with garlic sauce.  i don't like picking bones out of my chicken, so i tend to stick with the chicken bistec with garlic sauce rather than their famous #1.  with the chicken, they saute onions in the garlic sauce itself or, if you choose pork, they put raw onions on top.  both are yummy, but offer slightly different flavors (pork is saltier).  the portions are large (and come with rice, beans, and plantains), so you will definitely have leftovers.  i'm also a fan of the buttery garlic bread they serve as an app, as well as their cheap sangria by the pitcher.  the only downside to versailles is that the food is on the greasy side, but so tasty.\n",

One recommendation...stay away from the breaded and fried pork dishes.  I've tried several of them and they've all come out dry and disappointing.  I live right down the street and normally get takeout.  If you go during busy times, there's normally a line out the door.  In the times I've eaten there, service has been spotty and we generally had to flag somebody down to order or refill water.\n",

Last time, there were about 4-5 whole scallops nicely plated next to a piece of dried salmon, but the scallops were amongst the best I've ever had.    I went back after eating scallops elsewhere for two years, always thinking about how much better in taste and value the ones at Versailles were.  That memory went to hell, as the scallops were no longer whole and the taste wasn't there.   They ran out of sangria at 10pm on a Saturday night so the girlfriend and her friends were disappointed.  The chicken was good, even with the raised price, but still worth going back for, definitely.  service wasn't good, nor poor, just not attentive, but this isn't French dining so don't hold that against them.  order the chickens and i'm golden\n",

Dishes are served with rice, black beans, and plantains (I totally love the plantains.....).

Also, anything with onions comes with raw onions (fair warning!)  Easy parking, convenient location.  Hard to miss.  However, between Versailles and my usual cuban spot (El Rincon Criollo on Sepulveda in Culver City), I will go with ERC.  In my humble opinion more richer flavors, and smaller/more intimate.\n",

Truth be told, there is only one thing on their menu that has kept me coming back...  While the chicken, pork, and seafood entrees I've ordered at Versailles over the years have been too often overcooked, dry, or bland to put into my regular rotation, the slow braised tender goodness that is the Versailles Oxtail Stew consistently hits the spot.  Their garlic bread, rice, black beans, and plantains are worthy accompaniments and when paired with one of their tamales, the Oxtail Stew is easily a two meal proposition.  However, I have been known to conquer the Oxtail Stew in one sitting if I can keep my hands off the garlic bread.

Since it was lunch time and they offered lunch specials I decided to go with the shredded beef (only until after I ordered did I realize they boosted the price-- they meal was listed on the table's lunch menu as $8.99, but then they have a different hanging sign saying it's actually $9.99, plus another $1 if you want plantains instead of french fries).  Anyways, the meal came out and it looked like someone threw up on the plate.  The flavor was okay, but the portion of meat was actually very small (quite contrary to what everyone else was saying about portion sizes).  My fiance got the chicken version of the Cuban sandwich, which had 0 personality and 0 flavor (they didn't season it AT ALL). Our server also had 0 personality and the food took awhile to come out.    The beans, rice, and plantains were decent-- but the plantains reminded me of fast-food plantains like the kind you'd find at Pollo Tropical.  And black beans and rice just aren't that difficult to make.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm from South Florida and I've been going to my favorite Cuban place back home for the past 10 years.  But overall, I was very disappointed with Versailles and I definitely won't be returning.\n",

      "I have been going to Versailles since I was a little kid. Growing up in the valley I always went to the Encino location. I have had many great dinners at Versailles. When I moved to the Westside, I was stoked to find a location right by my house. Everytime I have been here, I have left happy and very very full. The service is not always the best, but it is always at least good. Some of my favorite menu highlights are: The Avacado and Onion Salad, the classic chicken and the chicken breast steak (#7A), the rice, beans and fried plantains. If you have some room left get the flan. More than likely you will take some of your dinner home, but don't worry, it reheats well. But the best part about Versailles, it won't cost you an arm or a leg for your dinner. A full meal is usually less than $15.

The sign outside looks like it's been up there for a hundred years ... that's ok - it shows it's character and longevity!  I also heard ALL THE STARS go there ... great place to nurse a hangover, I suppose.  I happened to be nursing a day of Disney (ha ha).  I ordered their pork dish.  Embarrassingly, I finished every bit of it.  Oh, and the platanos.  Yummy for Mommy!  On my way out, I purchased their sauce as hostess gifts!  I wanted to share the flavor and experience.  I do recommend going there, though.  It's addicting!  You'll see.\n",

I expected a decent portion but was shocked at how much they gave me...it was half a chicken!!! I was pleasantly surprised at the portion because I was left with leftovers of a complete meal. It also came with black beans, rice and fried plantains (you don't even need to order dessert!) The chicken was tender, juicy, and had amazing juices to dip.

However, me not being a chicken, beef, or pork eater, I was glad to see that they had a decent seafood section and I chose the Garlic Mahi Mahi. I didn't know what to expect. I was hoping it wasn't just some garlic powder sprinkled on overcooked fish. Thank goodness it wasn't. The fish was grilled just right so that it was still flaky. Then, it was smothered with this strong strong garlic sauce. I think the last time I had something with so much garlic was at Stinky Rose. It was all the way yum! And, I don't know what they did with the white rice and black beans, but they were great! The fish also came with a side of mixed salad. This was perfect cuz I needed something to wash down the garlic taste. I finished off the meal with some friend plantains that came with the dish. Even though I'm not a fan of fried fruits, they were good. Needless to say, this place gave me heartburns that evening..but it was all worth it. ^_^ Big 5 for great food, good/fast service, relaxed setting.\n",

Where else can you get that around West LA besides going back home to your parents' house? Versailles answers all our prayers. My co-workers were aware of my big appetite when I get really hungry so they highly recommended this place. This place gets crowded and has a homey feel to it. Lots of folks and families eat here, as well as the local business types. The waiters are friendly, attentive and VERY FAST. After we ordered our food, it arrived less than 5 minutes later. I ordered the famous Garlic Chicken. It was very a vinegary baked chicken, with sliced onions on top, served with black beans, plantains (banana), pico de gallo and rice. Very filling and satisfying. Parking can be tough as the lot gets full quickly, (the lot is very small and tight) and you might have to park on the street.

The decor is festive, and there's usually a line outside on the weekends, so they're doing something right. I do feel the need, though, to mention that the last time I went the tip I left was \"enhanced\" by the time I got my credit card bill.

      "Tasting the Cuban Menu at Versailles Culver City  It seems like a lot of folks take Versailles for granted. It's the reliable neighborhood place for Cuban-style garlic chicken. I like the homey-style of this restaurant, where the walls are lined with photo art from Habana. The pictures were lovingly taken by Raymond, one of the family offspring, who was there graciously explaining each item that we tasted. I had the good fortune to dine there twice in the last couple of months for tastings of many of the dishes I have neglected in favor of my usual order of garlic roast chicken. There is much more to Versailles' menu than I knew about. Number one is: Cubans have their way with pork. Take, for example, their pork tamale. It looks rather ordinary until you notice it's served with their house citrus (mojo) sauce. It brings out the flavors in the masa. I loved it! I've returned after my first visit and purchased a bottle of the sauce to serve on roast pork at home. Delicious! I also favor the masitas de Puerco, a crisp chunk of marinated pork, flash fried. This reminds me of Filipino crispy pata or Mexican carnitas. You have to be a pork fan to love this stuff - and I am. Lechado Asada is a roasted shredded pork dish topped with thinly sliced onion and, yeah, mojo sauce.  I also learned that Cubanos hanker for vivid flavors over hot and spicy ones. Case in point is the Rabo Encendido which was a particular favorite of almost all the folks at our table. This is worthy of going back for. It's oxtail, simmered for hours in Cuban spices, bell peppers and a hint of tomato. It's featured on the plate with just a little sauce and the customary rice and black beans. It is so tangy and tender that you want to pick it up with your fingers and slurp up all that meaty goodness from the juicy nooks and crannies. Okay so, - me and my uncouth friends did just that! When I go back I will order it up with plantains on the side along with white rice and black beans. They also offer moro on the side which is a mixture of those two dishes. I love their thick, but soupy, black beans too much to mix them up with anything else. Next time I go back I will also probably share the fried red snapper. At first glance this dish appeared too crispy. It looked dry, but when I bit into it there was a definite succulence that gave a good texture to what would otherwise be a boring dish. Did I say it's so good with the house sauce? Their paella is a little different from the one I've enjoyed in Spain and Portugal. Cubans serve a saucier version with hints of bell pepper, tomato, shrimp, chicken and chorizo. I like their version, it's zesty and not dry. My favorite dessert is the guayaba with cream cheese, but most folks love the flan.  So I am definitely planning on going back. The prices are good. Garlic chicken is only 10.95 for  1/2 a bird. Rabo is $14.95 Most dishes are between $10 and $15 and Paella is $22. I notice a brisk take-out business going on. Considering the ample portion sizes, I can see a family sharing a good meal for not too much $$. On my driving scale of 1 - 10, I would drive at least 10 miles for a good plate of Versailles comida Cubana.\n",

      "I've never had Cuban before Versailles. I didn't know what to expect. Spicy? Salty? Sweet? Bland?? But oh my, where have I've been living all these years?? I've been to two of their locations: La Cinega and Venice Blvd. In both locations, the food is amazing, the service great, and the buttery bread... omg the bread. Your heart will love you, your thighs will hate you!!! The only con (in both places) is the parking... It sucks.   I usually go for their \"#6: Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken\". The garlic sauce has a hint of lemon in it that gives it the perfect bite! Their \"#13: Salteado Rib Eye Steak\" is pretty good too. Try the \"Higado a la Italiana Italian Style Liver\" if you're feeling adventurous. Delish!!\n",

      "I love this place, the food is so good!   I've only gone in the evenings and it's usually busy. Their Lechon Asado Cuban Style Roast Pork, is bomb, as well as all of their chicken dishes. My favorite is the Chicken with Yellow Rice, and also their Paella Valenciana. Paella is delicious you're able to order in different portions, for one or for two.   The atmosphere feels like home lively and also with the lights slightly dimmed. The service is quick and helpful as for the Paella, they note that it takes about 45 minutes for them to prepare the dish. You're able to get take our orders as well. The prices aren't too bad for their quality of food.   Parking sucks, they have their own lot but it gets full fairly fast.\n",

      "Beautiful and clean interior. Not enough parking as usual. Delicious food and great service pretty much describes Versailles to me.  Complimentary garlic bread appetizer (the kind that's dripping with garlic oil) was hot, fresh and delicious.  My half-chicken bbq plate was huge and smothered with sweet (kind of too sweet) sauce and I had to take some of it home. The plantains were cooked to a gorgeous brown and tasted just as amazing. The black beans and rice complimented my meal well.  Caramel flan for dessert was good but nothing to write home about.   Final bill: $64 for four adults.  Why only 4-out-of-5 stars? The chairs felt a bit uncomfortable but then again I was sitting up against the wall and my ass is probably too huge for them.\n",

The second time I came here i tried the Garlic Pork chops which weren't bad but a little on the overcooked side.   Overall the food was flavorful and you get your bang for the buck because I was stuffed with food at the end of the night.  Make reservations early to accommodate big groups\n",

      "Bring me a #6, a pile of napkins and lots of room, please.  The 6, of course, is Versailles' renowned signiture dish, Cuban roasted garlic chicken.  It comes with perfectly cooked rice, ambrosia-like black beans and fried plantains. It's topped with a secret citrus sauce and shredded onions and is perfect!  How many restaurants can claim a legitimate 10?  At any given time, I estimate that some 80% of those in the dining room are feasting on it.  Versailles also features an array of sumptuous Cuban fish and pork dishes and offers a black bean soup from heaven. The avacado salad is also outstanding.  The food also travels well and I've been to many parties that they have catered  Prices are very reasonable, portions more than ample, service is excellent  and the restaurant has a decent-sized (and free) parking lot.  And don't let the lines scare you -- they move quite quickly.  One caveat: be sure that you're packing breath mints as the garlic chicken is as potent as it is delicious.\n",

Dont fry the chicken and say it is \"Roasted\" 5. Dont raise the price for lunch.(La Cienega Location) and charge xtra for plantains.

      "Homestyle Cuban food is served here, and it is quite delicious and filling. Pull up your car and park right in front, be greeted as you walk in to take a seat inside the large, spacious restaurant.  Start with an empanada. An order comes with two, so perfect to share with company. Beef is very good, one of the better empanadas I've had. Not dry, not too flaky, and the meat was tender and juicy.  Main course. I ordered the Lechon Asado, which is Cuban Style Roast Pork. You get a big plate with lots of roast pork, with a side of rice and onions to go along with it. It was very good. I could have used more rice since the flavor was stronger than I expected. While not overwhelming, there was more of a sour lime taste than I had anticipated. But the flavor and tenderness was good enough to let that pass.  My friend had the very popular Famoso Pollo Versailles. I had a taste; and the chicken, it was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Not bad!  This is certainly a place I can imagine myself coming again and again to try all their various dishes on the menu. Service can be a little better, but it's worth it for the food.\n",

My girl T got the lechon asado plate, bf got the pork chops, and I didn't wanna get pork also, so I got a steak sandwich. Eh. It was ok. Prolly should have gotten the traditional cubano, but everyone else was eating pork. Luckily bf shared since the portions are pretty big. Pork chops were juicy and nicely seasoned. I'd definitely go back for those. Overall the food was ok, I like to go again and give it another shot though.\n",

We lived down the street from this place for several years before eating here.  The line was always out the door so I wonder now, \"Why not sooner?\"  The service has always been great and the line, surprisingly, hasn't been our experience since we started dining here.

      "Pricing is not bad for the Westside, portions are quite large as well so you can have some to take home for lunch the next day... well maybe not if you have a large appetite.   Awww what did I do to get seated in the corner, totally felt like I got a time out! Though growing up I never got time-outs, my Asian parents stood by  corporal punishment. D= I know it was just chance that we got this table and that it was during prime dinner time so all the servers were busy... but they rarely walked all the way to the back to check on us I had to flag down a busser to get a waiter for refills on water.  I ordered the #1 chicken which was recommended by our server, the Famoso Pollo Versailles. It was came with tons of onions on top, which was wasted because I do not like raw onions maybe a couple thin slices in a burger but that's it. I wished they were grilled would probably make the chicken even better. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was quite flavorful, but maybe it was the way they prepared it but it had the potential to have been more juicer and tender. The black beans included was generously portioned, cooked to to the right consistency to be soft but not mushy. Great addition to the rice to provide even more filling protein.    This restaurant has a welcoming color scheme, of sponged painted ochre and maroon perfect for winter nights as it warms you visually. I would recommend this restaurant for large parties, the restaurant accommodates as necessary by pushing multiple tables in a form of \"table tetris\".\n",

This place is good food, good value, and has been around forever.  I first ate here around 1986, and have come back with friends and family several times a year ever since.  There have been a few changes over the years, but the plantains, the pork and the chicken have remained amazing throughout that time.\n",

Whenever I go to Versailles, I cant seem to get anything else because the smell (garlicy lemony  chicken) of it tells my brain I wont be happy unless I order it ...and I always am. Once the chicken was a bit overdone, but this isnt a fine dining restaurant so I dont expect  it to be perfect every time.  I just order it and hope for the best. :) The portions are huge so I usually eat half of it and take the rest home. It can easily feed 2 people. 3.5 stars.\n",

      "I don't get to eat Cuban food too often, unless I want to bare the crowds and get a pastry or quick lunch plate at Porto's. So when I get the chance to go to VERSAILLES I am in PURE heaven. The best Cuban food (other then my aunt's that I have tried in LA)   Honestly, I haven't tried too many items on the menu because each time I go back I always crave my FAVORITE, Ropa Vieja. For those that don't know it's a shredded flank steak in a tomato based sauce. Their dish comes with a side of arroz y frijoles negros (served as separates or as moros y christianos) and with plantains maduros (the fat sweet ones). I personally eat both kinds, the sweet and salty ones that are closer to the chips you see at the store but thicker.   Their price point is AMAZING, the Sangria is delicious, I like the fried Yucca or croquettas as an app, and finish off the authentic meal with a Cuban coffee at the end of the night and I am telling you'll crave a cigar before you even know what hit you.   Old school restaurant with home cooked flavors, oh and did I mention I am a BIG fan of both Garlic and Butter, both a must if you are going to dine with the Cubans...\n",

I always get the shredded pork with plantains, black beans, and rice.  You ever have that one dish that fulfills a little niche among your tastebuds and you crave it no matter what, well this is it for me.  You should go and find one for you too.  You will be a happier person.\n",

The avocado \"salad\" was really just a chopped up avocado and some onions... It was fine with the garlic sauce, but I dont know what I would have done without that sauce... And I'd hardly call it a salad.  But whatever.  The fried yucca was fine.  Nothing special.  And the Mojitos were ok.  I was expecting a muddled beverage with floaty bits, but it looked like it may have just come from a pre-made bottle.  Still tasty, but not quite what I expected from an authentic Cuban place.\n",

Your garlic sauce doesn't taste the same, it tastes like the bottle stuff you are selling which you claim is the same sauce, but trust me it tastes different.  I come to expect not the best service, but some of your staff is just not attentive at all and pretty rude as they are trying to turn over as many tables as possible.

      "Versailles serves some of the best food I've had outside of Miami and I've only found a couple of restaurants that are comparable.  One in Scottsdale, AZ and another here in Seattle, now sadly closed.  Like I've said previously in another review for their restaurants, the meals are big enough for two people.  Order an entrée and an appetizer and you will be set.  Or just gorge with your stretchy trousers on... because you will end up with Cuban food baby when you are done.  The garlic chicken or any of their pork dishes are a good first choice.  My boyfriend loves their lamb dishes and on our last visit, I enjoyed their beef stew.  Don't forget an order of yucca frita or get the Ejemplares De Versailles (sampler plate) with one of their salads.  You'll get a little of everything (ham croquettes, stuffed + fried yucca, a tamal and masas de puerco) plus you can trade bites with your partner for some of their food.  We've never had a miss here, food-wise.  Sometimes the service can be cranky but the food makes up for it big time.  Don't fill up on the toasted buttery bread that they will continue to bring until you say stop!  Grab an Iron Beer or one of their proper beers and enjoy the excellent food : )  PS.  One day we will save room for desserts.  We've always been too full to indulge.  We've never been tempted because the platanos are just so sweet!\n",

      "The first time I ever had Versailles was almost 20 years ago.  This is when my tastebuds were extra virgin and still reeling over the power of cilantro.  How is it that an herb that tastes like grass complement food so well?  So you can imagine my experience at Versailles.  First of all, I don't think I had ever waited so long in a line to eat - maybe to watch Batman or E.T., but for food? So I get in and order the chicken plate.  First thing that catches my attention were the bananas.  What! Cooked bananas? They were so delicious - starchy, not too sweet with a great roasted flavor.  I tried to recreate this in my kitchen and failed miserably.  Little did I know at the time that they were not bananas but plaintains - duh.  The accompanying white rice and black beans were a bit surprising also.  This is because I didn't know that anyone other than Asian people ate white rice.  Thank God that they didn't have soy sauce.  Just the thought of seeing another person eating white rice with just soy sauce would have made me go crazy - the first time I saw this was at dorms in college.  Finally the garlic chicken. Hol-y hell.  Who the hell puts so much garlic in their food? And what's with the sourness.  This dish would have been more appropriately named Lemonhead chicken.  But I couldn't stop eating.  I came back week after week, each time trying something different.  I was fascinated and intrigued by all the exotic flavors - almost like \"reading\" my first Playboy at age 7. I couldn't put it down.  Now I find myself still regularly eating there but not as often since I have moved out of the WLA area.  I still see some of the same guys waiting tables there. The mojo sauce is the best I have ever had including any I have tried in Miami.  The dishes I always fall back on are the mojo marinated pork and occasionally the oxtails.  If you have not had oxtails, you are missing out.  Tender beef in a tomato based sauce that just falls off the bone.  A bit challenging to eat but so worth it.  Unfortunately, I have never had the patience to wait for their paella.  And if you are a coconut fan, you must try their coconut shake.  So much shredded coconut, your straw will beg for forgiveness from getting clogged constantly.  And you know that Versailles serves great Cuban food if it is voted best Cuban by the people in Miami.\n",

The sides of black beans, rice and plantains also topped of the combination.  I also did the #33 Camarones Enchilados. The shrimp were plump, tender, hot, and the sauce was bangin'!

This place is pretty damn cool on the outside, and on the inside, there's a vibrant spanish vibe to it. Of course, it is accompanied by the the decor which entails includes an Acapulco styled interior.  Once we came in, we were greeted instantly by someone and seated immediately. +1  The complimentary bread is ammmmazing. It is baked to perfection and smothered with creamy butter. Anyways, there's a lot of different types of meats on the menu, but i decided to choose the shredded beef for about 13 bucks.   I must say the shredded beef was amazing. It came out hot, and once I bit it, the flavor was so just so strong and succulent. The meat was super tender. They put some sauces around it to add a lot of flavor to it, so it definitely tickled my fancy. The portion was pretty big too!  Anyways, it was definitely a good place. Service is good. Food is good. Not too expensive.\n",

      "Lots of overpriced dishes...the line cooks must laugh at how much people pay for food that are basically made completely from super cheap ingredients. It was a let down...service was nice though but Ill never go there again. Spur of the moment decision and the 4 of 5 reviews gave me confidence.  I had the lechon #1 and the versailles sampler...both paled to any mexican dishes Ive had...not much love in the food I feel :(\n",

I'm sure it's bad for you but I could care less when I'm dipping the Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken into even MORE garlic!

The first time i visited you I ordered the arroz con pollo and it was very tasty but the second time...ah the second time I went back to the basics and ordered black beans, rice and fried plaintains. The bf ordered the half chicken the first time and the garlic was soaked up by the plaintains and it was an explosion in my mouth. The second time he ordered the oxtails and my were those big. They were juicy and just pure bliss. I also enjoy your milk shakes which are more like smoothies than milkshakes. The coconut was my first and the banana my second. We will meet again Versailles, trust and believe.\n",

      "The original Versailles on Venice has authentic and tasty Cuban fare.  The dinning room is bright yellow and ox blood.  It was full at lunch.  I looked the menu over for a yucca dish - love fried yucca with sweet garlic sauce - but finding none, I ordered fried plantains, rice and beans.  It's a simple Cuban dish, and the folks at Versailles made it perfectly.  The plantains were young and ripened perfectly before frying.  The beans were flavorful and cooked to perfection.    I've only eaten here once, but I will definitely return.\n",

      "My first impression was, \"CUBAN food has won my heart.\"  The Famous Garlic Chicken with fried plantains is really all you need to order! The chicken is cooked very well and the tangy, savory, flavorful, garlic marinade is just delicious! The chicken is so tender and goes great with the sweet caramelized onions. The portion is pretty big enough to share. It also comes with fried plantains which are a sweet, satisfying treat with the chicken. I still can't deny that the best fried plantains I've ever had were at Bossa Nova Brizillian Cuisine, but this does the job too. I am serious: I never knew how much I love these sweet fried fruit, I can eat it as a meal! The side of beans and rice were delicious, and I think I could just eat that alone.  This place is pretty packed, but the service still remains in good quality even though every table to you is usually filled left and right.  The lasting impression? \"The Garlic Chicken has a unique and memorable marinade that I will remember Versaille's for!\"\n",

Neither of us were pleased with our dishes.   The portions are huge, don't get me wrong but honestly, I expected more from all of this Yelp hype... it was really just okay and I definitely wouldn't try it again.  I also ordered my rice mixed (since Yelp told me that was the thing to do) and  I found the rice to be dry and flavorless, even with the beans mixed into it.   We also tried to order the fried mashed potato balls, which they didn't have. I ordered the tamales instead and they were wet (yes wet?!) and barely had any pork in them.

      "Eat It or Beat It? **EAT IT!!**  One word: CUBAN. Versailles serves up one of the best Cuban food in LA and the prices are very reasonable and the food quality... spectaculuar! If you're looking to come around prime-time... there will definitely be a wait, but definitely worth the wait!  Versaille's Famous Garlic Chicken ($10.95): First off, the portion is HUGE! Every table I saw get this item did not finish, so unless you're a fattie and have a big appetite, I suggest sharing this item with someone! This garlic chicken smelled soooooooooooo good and tasted just as great! The garlic was not too overpowering and the juices from the chicken was just so yummy. The chicken was very tender and juicy, no complaints!   Rice/Black Beans (Comes as side dish): Rice was moist and the beans were just right! Not too dry like the ones at Cafe Habana Malibu, which sucks by the way if you've tried the one in NYC, so don't go there. I am still bitter about that place. Back to the rice and beans, it was bomb!  CONCLUSION: If you love cuban food as much as I do, this place is great and the service was very friendly! They serve you up some bread in the beginning with olive oil smotherd on top. Garlic chicken is defintely a must-order if you're a newb. Other yummy menu items include the Ropa Vieja (pulled pork) and the Pollo con Arroz (Chicken with Rice).  So I say, EAT IT!!!\n",

      "Yum yum. When it comes to guilty pleasure food, Versailles is a fine candidate. You really can't go wrong with their meat dishes, although I do have my favorites--their famous garlic chicken and top sirloin steak stand out. The flavor has completely permeated the meat and rice, with onions adding a finishing kick. One of the most delightful parts is the plantains on the side--it balances out the rich flavor of the meal with sweetness. Serve with a drink of sangria and it's a perfect hearty meal. Delicioso!  Parking is a bit tricky as there aren't always enough spots when it's busy, but the restaurant has a private lot marked off with a gate adjacent to it.\n",

      "Wow. wow. wow. The food was so tasty, I don't even know where to start in this review.  Let's all start from the beginning- friendly staff that greeted us at the door, rearranged our table to fit 10 even though not all were there, and with a smile on their face asked us to move while saying sorry the whole time when the rest of our party didn't make it.    They  gave us this addictive buttery garlic bread- it's so yummy! From a group of 5, the lechon asado (#1), el famoso pollo versailles (#6), vaca frita (#21) and the rabo encendido (#14).  Everything was really delicious- so it's all a point of what you're wanting to eat that day.  If you want beef- any of their beef dishes will probably do.  Chicken- for sure the pollo versailles (it's one of their best sellers) and it's so juicy and the garlic lemon sauce they drench it in is mouth watering.  Not to mention that they give you a whole half chicken.  The rabo encendido was really delicious- ox tail but remember that ox tail doesn't come with a ton of meat, but it's oh-so-delicious!  I personally got the Lechon Asado which is shredded pork and that was REALLY good.  A little on the salty side compared to the other dishes, but they also have a lot of lemon flavor in there so it's totally fine.  Apparently there's a combo lechon and chicken so you're not sure what you want, get the combo.  The portions are pretty big- and I was full I couldn't even finish my lechon. So sad.  I'm also not a HUGE fan of beans, but these black beans that came with your meal on the side (if you didn't ask for Moro) is delicious!   Can't wait to come back here to order the seafood paella which looks bomb.. but takes 30+ minutes to make\n",

      "Had high expectations. Really high. Lots of reviews promise bold flavors and lots of garlic and onion, and who wouldn't like that?  Unfortunately, our experience wasn't great:  - No refills on sodas. I get this at Fogo De Chao, not so much a casual place.  - Sandwiches aren't served after lunch hours. We were really hoping to get a Cuban sandwich and were bummed they didn't have it. - I tried to audible to a fried pork chunks dish, but they were out.  So, the order was ultimately Bistec Empanizado (breaded sirloin steak) for me, and shredded pork for the wife. I will say, the sides of fried plantains and moro were delicious, and I'd definitely recommend them. Unfortunately, my steak was pretty uninspiring - not well seasoned, not a lot of flavor. The wife's shredded pork definitely had a lot of flavor to be fair, but I don't know - maybe I'm used to Mexican, but I need my shredded meat to have some kind of accompanying edible holder, such as a tortilla or bread. The shredded pork was actually best as leftovers for makeshift Cuban sandwiches at home.   It could be that we had the wrong expectations and ordered the wrong items, but this place didn't quite do it for me. If the experience was just a little better I would be motivated to return and try it again, but unfortunately there are other new places to try and old standbys to enjoy.\n",

      "I'm trying really hard to be objective but being as this is my first time eating Cuban food, I was blown away. At zero times did I ever feel like I didn't belong. You know how white people must feel when they go to the hood and eating chicken and waffles. I couldn't even tell you if my waiter was the owner or the man because he was so friendly and service was superb.   The food was over the top. I ordered the shredded beef and you know how when you eat kalua pork and how every bite is supposed to be kickass? But it's not because you're at a luau and there's no Native Hawaiian eating this stuff? Well Versailles is the complete opposite! EVERY SINGLE MOUTHWATERING BITE WAS THE SAME KICKASS PARTY IN MY MOUTH. Caps really is the only way to tell you how delicious this was. My date ordered the chicken and wow, that was pretty kickass too. None of this dry friend chicken that you'd get from a Vietnamese place. But SAVORY.   That sums it up pretty well. SAVORY. I'm so impressed, I need to find a Cuban place in the bay otherwise I'll be driving down next weekend to So Cal.\n",

      "Oh Versailles. I want to like this place, I really do but this was my second visit here and I don't feel particularly compelled to come again. The service is average and the food is average, but it's not too far away and works decently as a basic sit down restaurant that doesn't take too long.   A friend and I came here for a Saturday night dinner because she was interested in trying a little Cuban food. While yelp here says they take reservations and I've made reservations here before, I was told that is not the case when I called in to make one.  Perhaps they've since changed their reservation policy or specifically do not make reservations on Saturday nights, but I'm still confused. Regardless, since they weren't taking reservations, we basically stood in a line outside the door and waited about 10 minutes. I find it strange that they didn't take people in based on their group size but instead, strictly on the order of the line. If you were at the front of the line, then you got a table next regardless of whether you had 2 people or 10 people in your group.   Once in, the food was pretty quick. We were started with some basic bread that comes drenched in butter (I'm not really into over buttering my bread; I felt that all the butter made the otherwise hard bread too greasy,  but to each his own I suppose). I then ordered the Lechon Asado, aka Cuban style pulled pork. Versailles gets an A for portion size; For $12 you get a huge scoop of rice, a sizeable plop of pulled pork slathered in onions, some plaintains, and a cup of black bean soup. I consider myself an average eater and was only able to finish about half the plate (saved the other half for another meal!). However, the food itself was pretty average. The garlic sauce they use to marinate the pork is too sour. While it's a great flavor burst for the first few bites, the sauce soon becomes a bit overwhelming. They must give you all those onions and rice to balance out the sourness, but then you end up filling up mostly on the sides and less on the main course. Further, the mild tartness of the plaintains actually hurt my tongue because my taste buds were so overwhelmed by the pork marinade.   I also had a bit of my friend's garlic chicken since many reviews seem to rave about it. I was disappointed to also find this quite average in taste. While the meat had a nice moist and soft texture, I didn't find the flavor particularly garlicky or generally notable.   Overall, the service here is fine. The waiter was extremely friendly, almost to the point of creepy, but everything was quite quick and accommodating. I'd be willing to come back if a friend had a particular craving for Cuban food, but I'll definitely be trying other dishes.\n",

      "I've been coming here since '05 when my roommates and I first moved to this area and discovered it. I came back here last night and decided that more people need to know about this place, so I turned to Yelp! I don't know what authentic Cuban food is, but I'm sure this is damn close, if not it. They're very consistent w/ their food and service.  +1 First of all, you walk in and about 8 servers with thick mustaches are standing there ready to help you. You feel like royalty! Once you put your food orders in, the food comes out fairly quickly, within 10-15 minutes I would say.  +1 For the food! Almost everything comes in large portions with plantains and beans, rice, or morro (rice and beans mixed together). Most of their signature dishes are in a garlic mojo criollo sauce unlike any garlic sauce I've ever tasted! Their Halibut al Ajillo, Famoso Pollo Versailles and Lechon Asado are all cooked in this sauce and they're all a must-try!  Their Famoso Pollo Versailles is almost half the size of a whole rotisserie chicken, served with the garlic sauce and perfectly slow-cooked to the point where you can easily rip off the meat and taste the locked-in, juicy flavor. (I would skip the pickled onions from this dish... but that's just me! I'd prefer grilled, but I can see how the acidic taste complements their garlic sauce.)   Their Carne con Papas is also slow-cooked, tender and juicy bites of heaven!   +1 For their Sangria. When sangria comes out and the server refills it with the fruit still fermenting inside, *ohhhhhmg* you know it's gotta be good.  +1 Tres leches! They also serve this dessert as an alternative slice of birthday cake and it's delicious. You SHOULD leave room for this dessert, despite their large portions. I also love how ALL the servers participate in the birthday song by turning off all the lights and singing in a deep baritone \"Happy birthday dear, panchita/panchito,\" it's so playful and cute.  -1 Parking/Location sucks, but get past it and I will promise you that it's worth it.\n",

Spots are very limited and if you don't have a tiny car good luck backing out! There was no wait when we got in. I had the chicken and pork combo plate. The portions were small considering the price and this economy. I was not crazy about the lake of sour butter sauce the food was sitting in. The chicken was good and so was the rice. The pork was just ok. The raw rings of onion teetering on top of the food was awkward and kept toppling onto the table... Ewww! We also ordered the beef empanadas, they were just okay as well. I've had much YUM empanadas elsewhere. They give a basket of bread before the meal arrives.

We arrived at an off peak hour so we didn't have to wait. My friend ordered the 1/2 BBQ chicken and I ordered their well known arroz con pollo. It was served with yellow rice and I looove yellow rice.   To my disappointment they were out of yellow rice. I asked to change my order. The waiter helped me choose. He recommended the chicken in garlic sauce. A flattened chicken breast was prepared in a garlic sauce with sauteed onions on top. White rice and seasoned black beans with plantains come on the side. The dish is overall plain but when you really start to mix the rice, beans and add a little bit of plantain in each bite the meal comes alive. Add the chicken and the onions and you've got yourself a hearty meal.  The plantains were delicious and the beans tasted a whole lot better than they looked, they were very flavorful.   The restaurant was decorated festively with bright red and yellow paint. I liked the feel and the staff was friendly. My expectations were met and I enjoyed the food better than Gloria Estefan's Restaurant on South Beach. I will definitely go back and I next time I will get the yellow rice.\n",

Other of my friends are hooked on the roast pork, and whenever there's a special it's usually popular.  This is a good late night place too, they're open for Cuban dinner hour (around 11:00)\n",

I forgo the salted, bay leaf-infused black beans simply because I like having friends. Make sure you order everything with a side of sweet fried plantains.

They also serve you warm bread which often times fills me up. Their mango shakes are also pretty good and can serve as the dessert.\n",

Delicious and light! The chicken breast was not dry either, which can typically happen.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because its my first Cuban restaurant experience and I'm not sure how better it can get.   Ive taken friends there since and they ordered the salmon salad which also looked good and received good reviews from my friend.\n",

The service was terrible (we were ignored, a waiter spilled a milky drink all over me when walking by and didn't say anything), they were out of the Cuban sandwich so I had to reorder...  The food was delicious upon first bite, but the flavors were one dimensional and quickly became too garlicky and too strong. The sauce was overwhelming; I had the roasted pork chunks in garlic sauce. And I love garlic! I found it difficult to eat more than a few bites. My friends' chicken was dry, which is funny because their dish was supposed to be the best thing Versailles offers.

Juicy roasted half chicken marinated an amazing flavorful, fragrant, tangy garlic sauce garnished with sliced crunchy onions.  Served with white rice, black beans, and fried sweet plantains. I usually ask for extra sauce because it's so delish. The plantains are tasty, sweet, tender and juicy. The rice is light and tasty.   *I don't remember the name of the second dish but it has oxtail in it. Very tasty and flavorful marination that's just perfect.

It has very tasty food, very large portions (so order carefully) a nice atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and the best damned roasted chicken in Los Angeles.  On the menu, it says \"Versailles Famous Chicken.\" If you've never eaten here before, or you have, but have never tried this dish...you need to. I love chicken prepared many ways, and the roasted chicken here is about as good as they come. It has an incredible tangy garlic orange sauce that causes a moutgasm with each bite. Ask for extra sauce.  Mmmmmmmm.  I've had a lot of dishes here, and never been displeased with anything. The rest of the menu is great too, but the chicken is something that can't be beat.

I have been supporting this Versailles location for 20 faithful years' yelpers.  I think it's obvious I love the food and I know the menu and staff intimately.  In 15 years I never once complained, however my last two visits this month left me disappointed. The food is still great but the PORTIONS are much smaller.  Small as in: of limited size; of comparatively restricted dimensions; not big.  I'm the dude who will bite the bullet and keep pushin'.  I'm not one to complain or make a scene but damn, I felt punked last night. My plate of Lechon Asado was served on a tiny hor dourves- size plate. It looked like I was being punished and sent to the kiddie table.  Seriously, I'm 6 feet, 200 lbs and you put this minuscule Happy Meal in front of me...wtf????   I understand the economy has affected the restaurants and the vendors.  I just wanted an honest answer to why the portions are so small and the prices so high.  My waiter admitted that they now use smaller plates but the portions are the same. BULLSHIT. They are putting a dollop of meat and rice on the plates.   I specifically went to Versailles last night to satisfy my voracious appetite and left unsatisfied. I feel like I'm in a relationship that is not emotionally fulfilling. If I can't receive the attention I feel my belly deserves in this relationship, I may be tempted to seek attention elsewhere!\n",

The La Cienega location is a lot older and doesn't see to get crowded.  I really like there lunch specials because you can get a ton of food for less than $10. I have tried there roasted pork, roasted chicken, and halibut and was very pleased with all of them. The chicken and pork were so flavorful with a ton of onions that had a lemon seasoning. There halibut was really good but was a little on the dry side. There plaintains are also very good and doesnt feel too greasy. The lunch specials were ready for me within 5 minutes today.

Had two excellent dishes:    I recommend the The famous Roast Chicken Steak 7A (its the same version as the half-chicken version, just without the bones)  If you are in the mood for seafood, then go with a Halibut Salad (same as the salmon salad, but with halibut) that has avocados.    Sometimes plantains get old quick, but today they were the best I've had in awhile.  I have had better rice and black beans.  The Sangria was average, but at $19.99 a pitcher ...

The reason I gave this place an average rating was only because of the food. I walked in and the employees just stared and waiting for some kind of response. I then sat down and they began speaking to me in spanish. I tried continuing on with conversation in english and it apparently wasn't going to continue on in the language I fluently speak, so i just kept nodding my head.   I ordered the \"famous\" garlic chicken, let me first start off by saying the bread was a great starter, the beans that came with the meal were ordinary black beans but with a \"chili-bean\" like aroma that somehow made them better for me and the plantains were good although they were mixed in my garlic-lemon sauce. So now for the chicken, this thing was massive. Like bigger than my calve. I absolutely love garlic but this wasn't a real garlic-ish flavor, it was lemony/citrusy? The meat was juicy and tender but the taste didn't give me a heart attack like I expected it to be. The side orders were better than the chicken, personally. So it was ok..  My drink was never refilled and neither was my bread, and I noticed as every female walked in, they were thoroughly \"checked out\" by the waiters. I was embarassed to walk out of the door. Kinda creepy. It was good to try but I don't think I'm coming here again.\n",

You won't hear Barry at the restaurant; just lively Cuban music-to-dine-to, as you consume the signature entree, good old #6 (garlic roast chicken) or any of my other favorites: roast pork, ropa vieja, and shrimp in garlic sauce.  With these, you can't go wrong.   I've been popping in here for many years, going back to when the chandeliers throughout the restaurant would flicker whenever the building's electricity usage shifted, well before The Big Remodel.   One thing I've learned in those years is that if you get there for dinner before 6:30 p.m., you'll most likely be seated immediately. But it has always been a popular place, and it starts filling up as 7 p.m. nears.   Don't be afraid to order to-go from here. The food maintains its integrity in the styrofoam box until you can properly plate it at its destination. If you dine in, you will probably need a similar box to pack a substantial portion of your meal as leftovers.   While prices here have been rising steadily since the '90s, they've just now reached a win-win balance for the patron and the house. If we can keep the status quo here for awhile, don't be surprised to see many happy faces passing through this restaurant's front door.\n",

      "It's really frustrating to constantly have Versailles come in up the LA Cuban food discussion because this can't be as good as it gets.  I basically only order the garlic chicken here because it really is good. However, I don't think a good garlic chicken solidifies a restaurant as  good Cuban spot when the rest of the offerings are just so-so.   For example, my boyfriend, who is Cuban and whose mom really puts the hammer down when it comes to cooking- only orders the breaded steak or Cuban sandwich simply because you can't really mess those up too badly. Any other time he's ventured away from the two, the results have been too inconsistent. He swears the beans are canned and the sauce is too plain.   During our last visit, he was horrified to find that some tables were topped with Tapatio and that one patron was drowning his food in it. Not only was that appalling to him, it also indicated that something was wrong with the flavors because when the food's right, you shouldn't need condiments. This visit crossed the line for my boyfriend and he's now dubbed this chain, \"Vershitties.\"  From that day forth, in our search for Cuban food in LA, any review referencing Versailles has been disregarded or skipped altogether.   This place is now a last resort for when we're too tired to cook our own or when we want Cuban too badly to wait for a trip to El Cochinito or, better yet, to Florida (specifically La Teresita- where the food is three times better for half the price at Versailles).\n",

I did go to Versailles sometime back in college 5 years ago and I had one of these vegetarian plates... probably the first one and I wasn't too impressed.  It's pretty darn plain and nothing to go out of your way of, as a vegetarian at least, to go eat here.  But just be glad to know you have options in case if you're dragged here by a buncha friends who want to enjoy some good Cuban food.    On this second visit, yes about 5 years later, I find that the vegetarian options have not changed.  But I did notice on their Specials menu chalkboard, they had empanadas... and available with spinach!  Fantastic... give me an order please!  I actually got served the wrong empanadas first (cut into it only to find a slew of cooked chicken).  The waiter came back already realizing his mistake and got me the correct empanadas.  The spinach empanadas were not amazing, but at least I got something different from their vegetarian plates.  So I was satisfied, at least.

After getting a lotta recommendations to try this place out, I took the leap of hunger and got my grub on.  Though the parking quarters were really tight, I managed to get a parking spot right on the street.  Once we got in we were seated shortly since the massive wave of people showed up right after us.  Can I get a high-five for being the start of the rush?!  Thanks!  First off we ordered the famous garlic chicken.   Didn't you know any chicken dish that has \"famous\" in it is a must have right?!  Mind you I'm a sucker for sayings like... \"the best in town, number 1 in the city,\" and I have been bamboozled many times.  Gah!!!  Dam you NYC for advertising the best cheesecake at every corner store!    The chicken was served with fried plantains which would have been good if their sweetness wasn't soaking in the lemony garlic sauce from the chicken, a side of black beans, and white rice.  I mean... the chicken wasn't bad...  It was on the side of OK/good, it had a crispy tasty skin and all, but it just didn't taste like anything special.  The black beans were black beans.... I definitely had better Cuban style black beans elsewhere.  As for the Rib Eye Lomo Salteado in a tomato sauce...  same thang... it was aiight....  not bad.... just not up to the level of bombness I was expecting.  This dish was also served with the a side of rice and black beans, but the meat was kinda tough, and like the chicken the plantains picked up a lot of the tomato sauce from the beef.  One thing I did like from this dish is that there were french fries soaking in the sauce, and you can never go wrong with meat and potatoes!  The glass of sangria was definitely watered down and lacked a lot of flavor but! that Dos Equis was just right...  Granted it came nice and cold out the bottle, but how can \"the most interesting man in the world\" steer you wrong?  Did you know he once visited a psychic, just to warn her?  pshhhh....  what a G.  I know there's a lotta Versailles lovers out there, and I probably should try more dishes to make my mark since it's so beloved.  The staff was fast to serve, but it was so busy whenever I wanted anything else I had to holler one down.  It was a madhouse in there!  As for now 2.5 stars is where I stand cuz there's better Cuban in LA.

Because of the lack of research, I didn't even know the #6 was the thing to order. So, when the waiter asked me what I wanted, I went for the #1 pork special and the three I was with all said \"#6\" in row, like parrots. Or...like three things that repeat each other in a row. I'm a regular Robert Frost with the similes today.  As you know by now, the food was absolutely smashing! Wow! Way tastier than anything I've had at Felix in Orange.

The environment is noisy, but it's a very chill and easy-going place. The chatter around makes it a good place to come with friends of yours. I love lots of chatter in these types of restaurants.  They gave us a basket of bread. I'm a bread-lover. It was too buttery for my taste, but it wasn't bad at all. My big mistake was eating too much of the bread -- don't do it! More food is coming up!  I ordered their famous Versailles chicken. They said it was half a chicken and they mean it. The portion was huge and it was roughly 10 dollars! Great price! The chicken was very juicy (HAPPY!) and had a very interesting flavor - I loved it. It came with a side of plantains. I normally don't like cooked plantains but they made it delicious. It also comes with a side of black beans and rice (or you can mix it together - moro). The beans and rice are also very good.  Because I was so pleased, I took my boyfriend here. He can eat a lot, but he'll only eat a lot if he likes it. He loved it here. I recommended the chicken to him and I ordered the pork. We were both pleased with our orders. The chicken was filling because of the huge portions and the pork was delicious. I love the added lemony taste they add to their food. He was happy and I was happy.  Parking is unpredictable, you may or may not get a spot. There is definitely a dinner rush; luckily both times I got there one was after and one was before it. Service was not bad, no complaints.\n",

When the man seated behind me stood up to leave he bumped into my chair - it was not his fault since there was only a couple inches clearance.  My salad was served at the same time as my entree.  I did take a bite of my pork before I finished my salad and it was only slightly warm.  I have been here a few times before and got wonderful service in the past, where I felt like they appreciated me. Today's experience was very disappointing.\n",

I particularly enjoyed the onions with the chicken for some reason, I just thought they went well. The chicken had too much of a citrus taste and it was just a bit dry. The sangria was a little weak and they served it in a weird pitcher, it didn't seem like it would hold a lot of liquid but it surprised me.Overall this place is good. Good ambiance, place was packed and it had pics of celebs on the walls, the service was prompt and friendly.\n",

This stuff is just so flavorful (without it being satly), I just end up sopping up the juices with my rice and black beans.   Seriously, even just thinking about this place is making my mouth drool. The pork and chicken in the garlic sauce with a kick of lemon juice. So dang flavorful. You Westsiders have it good with this little gem so close to you. Hmm, there is one in the Valley, but this is the first one I've gone to and I can't break tradition. I might venture out and try other things on the menu, but if it isn't broke, why fix it, right?

Once it has soaked into Whatever, you can Try all you want to remove that smell but it ain't gonna budge.  I even took it in \"twice\" to have it professionally cleaned and no such luck.  Now you may Think that the smell is gone after having it cleaned, but just you wait until a Hell Hot Day in Summer hits and badda bing, its baaaaack!  You've got yourself one hell of a Vampire Repellent.

The chicken was tender, juicy and packed with lots of garlicky flavor. I love the mojo sauce it comes with. Wish they gave more though cuz my sis and I were wanting more. If you ask for extra sauce, they will charge you $2. Say what? No thanks.   Steak was really hard and over-cooked. It's rare for me to say that steak is over done since I like mine medium, but this thing was so hard to chew and cut. Umm yeah.. Forgo the steak. Get the chicken, or better yet, try the oxtail stew. I heard that's a good dish.  Service was sucky. She seemed unhappy to be there, didn't bring out plates for us till way later even though I asked for them at the beginning. Dude, we need to eat our crumbly garlic bread without getting bread all over the table.  So, in a nutshell. Get the chicken to go. You can enjoy it at home and not have to worry about garlic breath.

      "I was hungry.  The BF must feel as if I'm getting fat, because he suggested that we WALK somewhere for dinner.  \"WALK?!\" I asked, incredulous.  \"In the dark?!  We'll get mugged!\"  His response was pretty much, \"We can go to Versailles.  It's just across the street.\"  True.  But I didn't like the idea of walking the dark streets - nope, didn't like it one bit.  He pretended to be deaf to my protests, and soon enough, hunger won out over fears of being mugged on the cold streets of LA.  We crossed Venice, stepped into Versailles, and I let out a sigh of relief.  We made it in one piece.  The restaurant itself brought comfort, too.  After all, it was brightly lit, surprisingly spacious, and bustling with customers.  We were seated quickly, a two-top towards the back of the room.  The decor wasn't all that special, but it was homey enough.  We were given our massive menus and left alone to peruse them at peace.  I opened it up and...  It's an indecisive person's WORST NIGHTMARE.  No joke, there are probably over a hundred menu items listed.  It took me at least ten minutes to get through the menu because I kept forgetting what I'd seen on previous pages.  Meanwhile, we were served some warm buttery bread.  Muy delicioso!  Crumbs flying everywhere, I continued to thumb through the menu, discussing possible options with the BF.  Finally, finally, I narrowed down my choices and... we were ready to order.  Except...  Except...  Except...  Hello?  Where's our server?  It seemed as if servers were whisking by EVERY TABLE but ours.  And in fact, we hadn't even been served our waters.  After absentmindedly chowing down on piece after piece of buttery bread, I was THIRSTY, yo!  No water, no server, no food.  What the heck?  Finally, we managed to flag down our waitress and we placed our drink and food orders.  A million light years go by, and still no drinks.  The BF is a patient guy on most days.  However, even he was getting antsy and annoyed with the service.  Strangely enough, it was ME telling HIM to chill out.  Twilight Zone status.  After what seemed like another few million light years, our drinks and food came out and...  I got some sort of chicken with lemon sauce, white rice, onions, fries, and plantains.  I opted for no beans.  No me gusta beans.  I don't remember what the BF ordered.  Anyway, MY DISH was not... pleasing to my taste buds.  The chicken was fine, nice and juicy and all, but... the sauce had to go home.  It was overly citrusy, to the point where it tasted like a sort of lemon vinaigrette salad dressing.  Pretty much, I thought it was way too sour (I could literally feel my taste buds puckering with each bite).  I didn't want the food to go to waste, so I had to do what I could to salvage it.  I asked for some hot sauce.  After slathering my chicken with Tapatio, it became more palatable.  Really, it wasn't the food itself.  It was the sauce.  I'm not keen AT ALL on that sauce.  I kept mentioning how it tasted like sour salad dressing...  And sure enough...  On our way out...  I saw bottles of \"sauce\" on the counter by the cashier.  It was some sort of Cuban lemon sauce... \"perfect for beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and salad!\"  OMG it WAS salad dressing!!!  How can ONE sauce compliment pretty much EVERYTHING?!  Maybe it's a Cuban thing and my tongue is just too uncultured to appreciate it all.  Whatever the case, I've decided that this Cuban lemon sauce is totally not my thing.  Now, if the service had been better (or even somewhat EXISTENT), I might not have felt so dissatisfied with the whole experience.  Too bad the service was even worse than the  lemon sauce.\n",

      "This is one of my favorite all-time LA restaurants. And it's now a regular request from all my out-of-town friends and family when they come to town.   The buttery bread, when it's hot, is delectable. I'd like to be buried in the roast pork and eat my way out. The garlic chicken is also fabulous, but I always find myself ordering the pork. I like to order my plantains on the side, so as to keep the pork juice from \"tainting\" their sweet goodness. I prefer to eat them as dessert with some sugar on top. And the sangria? Intoxicating! (Pun intended.)   Unless you order something other than the roast pork or garlic chicken (I think my hubby is the one of the few customers who actually does just that), the order-to-receive ratio is amazingly fast.   And I may hate myself for telling those of you who haven't experienced Versailles for yourself, but the lines outside on weekend nights actually moves pretty quickly because the table turnover is speedy.\n",

      "Cuban chicken and pork. Just the thought of that dynamic duo gets my stomach grumbling. But Versailles wasn't a home run for me, more like a base hit.  I've been to one other Versailles years ago, and I remember being underwhelmed by the over-hyped Cuban chain. This experience was no different. Maybe it's because I was spoiled at El Rincon Criollo ( http://www.yelp.com/bi... ), home of the crispiest chicken skin ever, that I was let down by my meal here the other day.   Being indecisive as ever, I got the chicken-pork combo plate and a guanabana milkshake. Within about five minutes, a mound of hot loving covered in onions was presented to me. A huge pile of rice, half a chicken atop a mass of shredded pork and a small side of plantains. I didn't even notice my cup of black beans until well after I finished eating.   http://www.yelp.com/bi...   The food was all good, but it just didn't sing to me. My main gripes were that the chicken skin was not crisp and the bright sauce covering the meats overwhelmed everything. But none of that stopped me from eating every last bite of my food.  But at least now I won't wonder what Versailles tastes like when I drive by all the time.  PS - Food Porn:  http://www.yelp.com/bi...\n",

      "Came here with friends. I shared their signature chicken with my BFF as she said it was a big portion. She asked for the sauce on the side as she said they would douse the sauce and it would be too much. We got the 'moro' instead of the beans and rice.  The food arrived quickly. I sampled the lechon also but it was so-so. It tasted like pulled pork without the bbq sauce. I'm not really into that texture too much. The chicken however was outstanding! Half a chicken butterflied and roasted to perfection, moist and succulent. The accompanying sauce was really tart and the flavor was very pleasing to me.  The moro was beans and rice mixed together to give it a 'dirty rice' feel.... I definitely liked that better than the beans and rice combo seeing the rice was just plain white rice and the beans was black beans -- the mix of them together was definitely a far tastier option.  Service is abrupt. He wasn't too happy when my BFF and I wanted to share, but hey, it was more than enough food for the two of us. The plate also comes with plantains -- I've never been a huge fan of plantains, but the ones here are done exceptionally well so I had a piece of it.  Thoroughly enjoyable meal!!\n",

I must say it's a bit refreshing when someone orders for you and you don't have to think (well, I guess it depends on the person and my mood... I can see that totally annoying me but in this case I was cool with it) The waiter nodded and walked away. I swear to the big guy up above he returned in under a minute with two gigantic plates with half a chicken on each, covered in onions with a side of plantains, rice and beans. The chicken was PERFECT! Crispy skin on the outside, moist white meat on the inside. The garlic sauce had a lemony touch. The plantains were perfect as usual and the rice and beans bland the way they always tend to be in Cuban cuisine. I devoured my food!  I'm so glad I gave Versailles a second shot....

As recommended by my friend that the Pork Lechon is good i ordered that one and since i'm filipino when you say Lechon it should be good!  And she ordered pork leg. Mine came in like a shredded pork no skin but all lean meat and some thin slices of onion on top, rice , black beans and some plantains.

      "Versailles is an institution in L.A., and therefore difficult to review. I have been coming here for as long as I've lived here, and a trip last night reminded me that I need to review it ... but how? You don't go to Versailles not knowing what to expect or because you are out for an evening full of surprises, you go because you know exactly what you're going to get:  good, salty, heartburn-inducing food, sort of tacky ambiance and service that is hardly ever better than \"meh.\" But, it's Versailles, so it's perfectly fine.  Everybody knows by now that the dish to get is the #6, the garlic chicken with onions. In the past though, I have had good luck with the pork chops and the squid ink rice--which Jonathan Gold once described very accurately as the color of asphalt ... yummy, delicious asphalt.   Last night, friend and I decided to go the cheap route and get one order of the chicken and one vegetarian plate--of rice, beans and plantains, and then just split the chicken. It was a good idea, too, because we both had enough to take home as leftovers.   Side note:  their \"vegetarian\" menu is pretty funny. It's comprised of two items:  the aforementioned plate of rice, beans and plantains, and another plate that offers the rice and beans served TOGETHER, plantains, and a green salad. Here's a tip--if you have vegetarian/vegan friends, DO NOT take them to Versailles. Looking at that menu reminded me of the scene in Everything Is Illuminated, when Elijah Wood's character explains that he's a vegetarian, and the others react aghast and ask, \"NO MEAT?\" Yeah, those two paltry veggie options is Versailles' way of asking NO MEAT?  Still, if you know that going in, and you are prepared for garlicky, salty goodness, head to Versailles:  you will not be disappointed.\n",

      "Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that this is not the original Versailles location, I've found the one in Palms to be vastly superior to the OG location on La Cienega.  Although this isn't fine dining, over the years the proprietors have tried their best to create a more spacious dining area and spruced up the tablecloths and tables to make it more inviting.    At the original location on La Cienega, the dining space is cramped and dingy.  Unfortunately for us, both locations seem to specifically hire waitstaff that dedicate the majority of their working hours to chatting with each other.  Luckily, the kitchen puts food out so quickly that their industriousness cancels out the servers inefficiencies.    Similar inequities in work input vs. uneven output is also how most of Western civilization is maintained.  See: US Bank Bailouts.  With that said, nobody goes to Versailles for ambiance or service.  The intensely garlic infused food is the main draw.  I've noticed the offerings adhere to an 80/20 rule nowadays:  80% of the time you get huge, delicious dishes, 20% of the time the dry and underportioned converse.  Which is not to say that I don't get a little miffed when I get the 20% side of the stick: but I figure the odds are still with me.  Goddamn that overarching Pareto Principle:   http://en.wikipedia.or...   After sticking with the famous half chicken and the roast pork for many years, my new go-to dish at Versailles is the Lomo Salteado.  Most people swear by the Ropa Vieja beef dish, but give the Lomo a try and tell me if it doesn't shred \"Old Clothes\" ass to pieces.    Also, try if at all possible to avoid sitting in the one female server's section.  If you thought her male counterparts were bad, prepare to be truly underwhelmed by the gross inefficiencies in her general work ethic.\n",

      "\"Yay, I'm so excited to be here...oh, that's it?\"  After a period of hiatus, I returned to Versailles last night with great expectations for their excellent food. I used to get very excited whenever I visit this place and would rotate between their garlic chicken, steak, pulled pork, and lengua dishes. The ambiance was dim but noisy, and unlike many places that have been hit hard by the economy, the crowd has yet to abandon their craving for a good hearty Cuban meal.  What I have quickly realized was the noticeable price increase while my dish failed to live up to its reputation. My garlic chicken had mixed results as the juicy dark meat was tender and delicious but the other half of the chicken was terribly dry and tough. The side of black beans was still a great addition to go on top of the rice, and the generous serving of plantanos continued to be one of my all time favorites. I was encouraged to see that they now have paella on the menu, but at the price of $19.95 the dish is a bit out of reach for me.  The server did not return to refill our water and the noise level was so high that my friends and I had a difficult time hearing each other during the entire meal. I figured to be back at some point since I'm not ready to give up on their other dishes, but my expectations will certainly be more guarded with the hope that they will help me to rediscover the very reasons for liking this place in the beginning.  A 3 star rating since the food and service did not correlate with the price of the meal.\n",

      "Cuban lesson of the day: sides available \"rice and beans or moro\" So what is moro we asked? \"well it is rice and beans\" So the options are rice and beans and rice and beans? \"yes\" ha ha basically moro is them mixed together, go figure!  So I HATE that I can't give half stars...so really this place get 3.5 stars but i'll round up for the amount of food you get on your plate ha  You have to come here hungry and prepared to eat A LOT. The bread they bring out first is lightly dusted with a garlic butter sauce and it is so warm and chewy and toasted a smidge and if you aren't careful you will lose valuable room for your entree if you eat too much of this goodness!   But after being impressed by the free bread, their croquetas with ham and cheese were not up to par. The outside was not crunchy enough and the inside just seemed like a semi messy puree of some sort, so I would pass on those next time. The tamales however were pretty tasty even though tamales seem like a spanish or mexican food to me and not cuban but then again the glory of cuban food is all of the influences that came together there to create its food--a little bit of everything from spanish to french to mexican to soul food ha.  My pork was cooked very well but the garlic mojo sauce criollo sauce was lacking a bit in the garlic flavor overall and my friends thought their famous garlic chicken was more lemony than garlic as well. Maybe they ran out of garlic tonight??? ha ha But these dishes were massive and came with rice and beans and plantains too!!  And my other friend could have married her rice in the arroz con pollo, she wouldn't stop raving about it in the car on the way home! Oh and get the sangria, because it is decent and actually not too pricey for LA   Cons: no water service, i guess he was lazy but he never brought us any, lack of garlic flavor, and the waiter getting mad at us for using four cards to pay for our bill.......hey we were paying were we not??? next time hold the attitude and bring me MORE GARLIC! ha ha\n",

      "As Lady Sovereign says, \"Everybody get random!\"  Nearly all first-time visits to this L.A. stalwart begin with the traditional house chicken or pork.  Don't get stuck in the garlic sauce vortex!  Get random and go for the odd-ball choices.    OK, if you're scared of jumping into the deep end... I'll give ya a pair of arm floatation devices to ease you in (seriously, you look great in these... I'll throw a rubber duck next to you for posterity's sake). Don't be scared by the line outside the door... it ain't for the X-ride at Six Flags and it goes by quick.  Go ahead and tell the server you'd like some \"old clothes.\"  Don't worry, the Ropa Vieja's literal translation is actually a common Cuban dish... it's an amazing tomato-based stew, encompassing braised beef.    On your next trip, your group plans ahead and gets there before the dinner rush wait.  Willing to push the envelope a little?  You're feeling a bit anti-establishment, so you ask for the ox-tail stew.  Your pals all give you a quizzical look, perhaps concerned that your sudden interest in lycanthropy belies something a wee bit more serious.  Ah, they've stuck with the garlic chicken/pork again... these guys wouldn't last two days in Havana.  Your plate appears, hosting huge cow-tail chunks in a mild, dark sauce (oxes are spared from providing their tails nowadays).  You may or may not be partial to the fatty parts attached to the meat... it's a similar consistency to tendon, but that's what I love about this dish.    Hmmm... if you've survived the first two rounds, make the third visit a solo, take-out jedi mission.  You're going to order the lengua guisada and your garlic chicken/pork pals may not want to see it at their table.  Similar to the ropa vieja, strips of tongue are cooked in a peppery stew.  I don't care what anyone says... tongue rules.  It's the meat that tastes you back.    Honestly, I haven't visited here in months- neighboring Gloria's (El Salvadorean) stole me away, with their superior plantains and beans. But writing this reminds me of Cuban excellence.  Three steps to random... live a little!   Edit 8/13/07:  I am officially on the El Rincon Criollo bandwagon.  I will never again wait in this godforsaken line.\n",

      "I was sitting at my desk last week , chatting with our lunch crew via Skype about what we should eat for lunch that day. Mind you, it was 10:30 in the morning - hey, we get an early start! Suddenly, another IM window appeared: \"Hey guys - we're ordering from Versailles today to celebrate a birthday, who wants in?\" I quickly scanned the list of recipients in the IM window - the entire lunch crew was included. It was unanimous...Versailles for lunch it was.  A lunch crew bud/Yelpy friend and I decided to split the \"Famoso Pollo Versailles\" - Versailles' famous garlic chicken. I've tried a few other things on the menu, but the garlic chicken is my favorite. Frighteningly enough, I could eat the entire entree myself on a normal day. :O Today, however, was not a normal day - I had actually eaten breakfast! needless to say I was up for splitting the entree...and I was not left hungry.The moro is yummy, but the beans and rice separately does the trick as well. The best part of all? The side of plantains. :)  Versailles is not the most convenient place to order lunch from (because of where the office is), but it's always a welcome lunch distraction.   4 shakas!\n",

      "It's a mystery why I keep thinking about this place considering when I break down each dish individually, I find that they're not particularly spectacular. The garlic chicken is a favorite of mine (and everyone else), but I really like the oxtail. Makes you wish for more than just the tail.   Gah! I crave plantains and yucca like no other. They're so hard to come by and are usually expensive. Versailles has both and includes them with most dishes, but if you really love plantains, I would just straight up order a side of them. The yucca is kinda overfried and unsatisfying.   This location is cleaner with better parking than the one on La Cienega. Since they're so close to each other, the only reason I can think of for going to the La Cienega one is that it's a little less crowded.

      "Versailles is a Cuban food restaurant chain that serves a roasted garlic chicken in citrus marinade that is addictive. The half chicken is the most popular dish. It comes covered in citrus marinated onions and is served with black beans, white rice and fried sweet plantains. The shredded roast pork flavored with the same garlic-citrus marinade is another favorite. A complete meal is cheap, totaling less than $10.  Pros: Versailles Cuban garlic citrus roasted chicken and pork that is so tasty it is addictive Complete meals for less than $10 Thick cold coconut or papaya shakes  Cons: Not enough parking  One of the busiest Versailles restaurants is the one on Venice Blvd. in Los Angeles, on the border of Culver City and a couple of blocks from Sony Studios. The mouthwatering aroma of the Cuban garlic-citrus chicken can be smelled a block away and lures folks into the tropical decorated cafe.  Versailles is always busy so the best time to go is 2-4pm, between the lunch and dinner hours. If you go during the busiest hours try ordering to go so you won't have to wait as long to savor the flavorful juicy meals.  Even though some folks always order the tasty garlic chicken or pork dishes because the flavors are so addictive, Versailles does offer a variety of Cuban dishes. Versailles offers steak, fish, paella and other Havana inspired dishes. Try one of their imported Cuban soft drinks or beers or have a delightful thick cold fruit shake made with bananas, papaya or sweet coconut.  *Tip:  bring breathmints as there's a lot of good garlic in their dishes.  if it's your first time ask for a recommendation from the waiter - when in doubt get #1 or #6.\n",

There seems to always be a line outside on the weekends, but don't let this deter you from going!  The food is absolutely worth the wait.\n",

Portions are large so you'll have food to take home (or go home stuffed).

We were a little leary as to all the hype this place gets. For the most part, it lived up to our expectations.   Walking in we were quite suprised. Of all the times we had driven by here and saw the lines we thought that it was a shmancy place. Upon entering, we were confused as to the hospital cafeteria decor. I'l admit that, for a moment, my nose turned slightly up to the air. Which actually, was a good thing. It allowed me to get a whiff of the smells in the place. And back to earth I came.  I ordered the Lechon Asado and the little lady ordered Arroz con Pollo white meat. The food came expeditously, much to our hungry delights. There was a quarter onion, sliced up, on top of my Lechon... and i devoured all of it! The black beans with the white rice were declicious. The pork was very tender and the marinade was not overwhelming. The sweetness of the plantains complemented the sourness of the marinade. My girl's Arroz con Pollo was seasoned perfectly. Including the rice. Tender chicken breast, not dry at all. Big portions on our plates.   We must have jus missed the start of the friday dinner rush because it got packed as we were leaving.

      "Oh garlic chicken... how you taunt me with your crispy skin and your juicy meat... I must say you tempted me to deviate from my order but I am glad my friend forgot you in my fridge and I got to eat you the next day, but I digress. I came here with the bf and my friend, Rach. He got the ropa vieja, I got the lechon, and Rach got the famous garlic chicken.  The ropa vieja was pretty good, the sauce was rich and the meat was properly stewed so that the shredded beef was soaking with the red sauce and it tasted awesome mixed with the beans and rice. But the real show stopper for me was the lechon. Roasted pork in their sour, garlicky mojo was too good. It was juicy and soft with garlic permeating through out the meat. It was improved by just a little more mojo and the yellow rice. The garlic chicken was also really good. The skin was crispy with all the fat rendered out of it and the chicken itself was still really juicy.  What keeps this place from being a 5 is that they didn't tell me they would charge me for little things and though I don't mind being charged I would like to be told. So when I ask can I switch the rice for yellow rice I felt like he should have told me yes for a dollar and not just say yes. Also the sangria was watered down and didn't taste like anything.

The menu is so large. I wasn't used to that. In Miami u have maybe 15 choices. Which would include appetizers, drinks, sides, main courses and dessert.  But this place had everythign under the sun and once I saw oxtails I was sold. WHen they came... DAMN!

I believe they are the tail of a cow but.... they are so damn good I don't care what they really are.

Amazing pork, everything was flavorful, service was nice and everything was spot on. My mother remarked that it was \"just like being back on 8th street\", which speaks for authenticity (in this case, authenticity in the form of dining quality, because the place looks as run down as some classy neighborhoods of Miami).

      "4.5  Tasty and cheap -- a winning combination.  Add  a lot of garlic to the mix, and I'm all kinds of happy.  I love garlic (I'm very lucky that Hubs does too!)  and garlic is all over this menu. Yum!  I usually get the Garlic Chicken and the boy gets the Cuban Style Roast Pork, and then we have leftovers for days. Both are juicy and flavorful and you really can't beat the price for what ends up yielding multiple meals.    The sides that accompany the meals are likewise tasty and abundant.   Even the rice in infused with flavor.  It's not the plain white rice it appears to be.  I think both the rice and beans are made in true Latino fashion - with a sofrito base to infuse the whole dish with flavor.  I recently froze the leftover rice that came with our takeout, since we were given soooooooo much.  Even after way too long in the freezer, when I finally took a chance, defrosted it, and used it as desperation side one late night for dinner, the rice had magically retained its flavor.  The plantains are not quite as amazing as my mom makes them - but that is an impossible level of perfection for anyone to reach.  These will do very well until I can have her magically teleport them from South America.   Last weekend I tried their Cuban sandwich for the first time, and it was predictably . . . DELICIOUS.   The bread was crusty, the pork deliciously savory, and mustard was definitely present, which is just how I like it.    Let's put it this way, last Sat. when I placed our order, Hubs and I were bickering and cranky because we had waited too long to figure out dinner.  When dinner was over, there was nothing but happiness all around.\n",

No extra bonus credit for my inconvenience. What the fu$&amp;?!!??!!! I used a frickin' credit card. How hard would it have been to just put some cash back to that OVER THE PHONE?!?!?!

      "Versailles is an LA classic.  It's a great place for a quick lunch and a great place to take out-of-town guests for an inexpensive but delicious dinner experience.   The garlic chicken is probably the most popular dish, but I don't enjoy cutting the meat off of bones, so I prefer the (unbreaded) \"chicken steak\" which is simply chicken breast in the same sauce.   For the biggest explosion of flavor, try the roasted pork (\"number 1\"). There's nothing quite like slightly fatty shredded pork smothered in garlic, butter, and onions with a bit of lemon for flavor.   Lunch specials (in the $6-7 range) are slightly smaller than dinner portions, but you still will not leave hungry.  The lunch specials normally come with french fries, but you can substitute their delicious cooked plantains (they'll let you call them \"bananas\") for $0.50 extra.   Lunch parties get seated almost immediately, but show up early for dinner as you'll have to wait in line on the benches outside.\n",

      "This place got degraded from my previous visit. First being greated nicely, then sat on our table for 10 mins with no waiter introducing himself to us.  Then got moved to different table, waited another 5 mins before the waiter came to take the order, without introducing himself. No smile on his part, nor a courteous service. When asked for a spoon it was like asking him for the world...  The food itself was good, but the service was really miserable. Even tho our server Andres tried really hard to serve us, he should show that he cared.   The check arrived faster than the service itself. I am not sure if he had a bad day, but won't step back in this restaurant at all regardless if the food was good.\n",

      "The food here will fill you up, and that's about it.   If you've ever had REAL Cuban food, this will disappoint you. heavily. Yes, I'm biased, because I've had home-made Cuban, and lots of it in Florida (spoiled =P).  If you could buy a chicken-flavored-powder, pour water over it, and have it turn into chicken. Somehow, this place has accomplished it. I think they cook the chicken, while armored with a bullet-proof-force-field (made of foil?), and leave it to roast overnight. Is that possible? That's my theory at least.  Service here is not attentive, and the food is just always DRY.  Typical black beans, rice, and plantains. Nothing special about anything here. You can find better rice, beans, and plantains at any Jamaican restaurant.   I suggest going to Florida, and acquiring some REAL Cuban delights. Then come here, and regret coming here.\n",

      "WTF?  Seriously, I have been coming here for years and I don't know if my tastes have gotten more refined or the quality at this restaurant is just going down the crapper?    I had the cubano sandwich and my mister had the garlic chicken.  My sandwich was dry and the bread tasted kinda stale and the pork was dry.  The chicken portions seems to have gotten smaller and the maduros were mushy an lacked the usual tasty flavor, same goes for the beans.  The price increase just makes me miss how good this place used to be.  The garlic chicken dinners used to go for $7.95 and was a true bargain. Now I think it goes for $9.95 or $10.95. I was so disappointed with my meal that I am not sure if I am going to come back. It is a sad day indeed.\n",

      "When I first went to Versailles as a picky child, I wasn't a fan. My parents still went without me and after years of passing by the location, I finally went again in high school. By then, my taste buds had somewhat evolved and I've never turned back.  I've had a few things off the menu - but all that needs to be said is that the garlic chicken is uhhhh-mazing. Sometimes it may come out a bit dry - but nothing a bit of extra sauce can't solve.  Plus the portions are mondo. Chicken + rice + black beans + plantains. And oh em gee the plantains add a little drop of vitality to every bite. There is so much food, you could eat it for days. Well, not really but multiple meals for sure.  Also - the arroz con pollo is so, so beyond heavenly. The rice is cooked to perfection. The chicken is perfectly tender.  Plus the food always comes out in a jiffy and we hungries love that. On that note - once your food comes out, they seem to always forget about you and it sometimes takes forever to get the check. But it's so yummy and they tend to be so busy that you have to let it slide.  And the prices are more than reasonable for what you get. Woot.\n",

      "We were visiting friends in LA this weekend and they recommended this place, so we all went. It was my first time trying Cuban food, and it was definitely a good experience.  They start you off with a garlic bread that was soaked in so much butter -- but so delish. I ordered the grilled mahi mahi w/ garlic sauce. It was good. It comes with plaintains (lots of plantains), white rice and black beans. The black beans were really good. It was a fun combination of food in my mouth. I tried my boyfriend's halibut, which was very good. My friend had the oxtail, but you can bet I skipped that one.  Service was pretty good. The place looks pretty unassuming from the outside ... nothing that makes me think \"oh, how cute!\" ... but it was full inside. The decor leaves a little something to be desired, but I dug the red ceiling.\n",

      "I was intimidated to order their famous garlic chicken because im not a huge fan of garlic so I tried a piece from my friends plate. It was pretty good but not something I would order for myself. You can smell the garlic from a mile away. Garlic definitely oozes out of your pores for days after eating a plate on your own.   I've been there 3 times and ordered:  1) The salmon - it was good but a little dry. I should have asked for lots of lemon. I would order it again if Im in the mood for fish.   2) The breaded chicken - I'd rather have the garlic chicken. This was not tasty.   3) The meat (I think it was pork) and potatoes - This is my favorite so far. The meat is tender and the seasonings are so good.   I always try to get something different each time I go. Maybe some day I'll be courageous enough to order the famous garlic chicken. I agree with some of the other reviews, don't order it if youre on a date. Nothing will get rid of the smell. On the plus side they serve a huge portion so you end up having leftovers.   The plantains are soft &amp; yummy and I love the black beans. Everytime I go I always want to order their desserts but I get so stuffed during dinner. Next time I go I'll try the guavas with cream cheese\n",

      "I hate over-hyping a place, I really do.  But for those of you that don't mind the rantings and ravings, I have to say that the Versailles chicken was possibly one of the best ... if not THE best chicken I have ever had.  EVAR.  My friend first recommended that I go when I told her that I was making a trip to LA.  Her eyes widened and she told me about this chicken that she still dreams about.  And now I know why.  If you decide to venture there after reading my accolades of the place, DEFINITELY get the #6.  The combination comes with rice, beans, soft and succulent plantains and HALF a golden, garlic chicken.    Garlic doesn't even begin to describe it.  Paired with the onion that comes atop the bird, one bite is filled with buttery, garlicy, lemony goodness.  There's this citrus tang that really pops on the palate, and I found myself eagerly awaiting the next tender bite.    My fellow diner just had the chicken breast, which was on the dry side - so definitely get the chicken that is still on the bone.  You won't regret it.  Another tip: go with a smaller group, show up early and make sure EVERYBODY is there at the same time or they won't seat you.  We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria to split among four people, which was refreshing.    When I make another trip out to LA, you can be sure that I'll have Versailles chicken on my mind.\n",

Don't know ... don't care. My mouth salivates when I think about their delicious juicy roasted chicken with onion dressed in vinegar salt and pepper - and I am NOT an onions-girl! In fact, I absolutely HATE all raw onions - except for the ones served at Versailles.   Of course I don't pay that much attention to other dishes when I dine at Versailles - but their maduros/platanos are pretty damn good - not overly sweet.  They could definitely use a little help in the decor department... but I guess that sort of hole-in-the-wall, too-cool-to-care-bc-we're-rollin-in-the-dough atmosphere adds to the charm.\n",

Versailles is fun, completely down-to-earth and definitely worth the wait in line.  And now it's 4am and I want fried plantains.  Damn you Versailles!\n",

      "I cannot speak for the other Versailles location, but this location is fantastic.  - The waiters are very nice and attentive. - I love the free, greasy bread you get to munch on before your meal arrives - I ALWAYS order the ox tail stew. I think it's one of the menu items that is such a hidden gem, that every one looks over.  The flavor of the stew is so rich and delicious, and the meat on the oxtail is cooked so perfectly -- meat falls right off the bone. - The rice, beans, and plantains that comes with all dishes is absolutely delicious too - Large portions at reasonable prices (about $10-$15 bucks/ person), I always have enough for two meals!  NOTE:  I know a number of friends who dislike Versailles' signature garlic chicken, and never set foot in Versailles ever again, as a result, since that's all other people recommend. I do not like their garlic chicken either, but there are just so many other wonderful dishes on their menu (like oxtail stew =D) that are worth trying. Don't let just one dish turn you off, from all the other wonder dishes they have to offer.   Love this place.\n",

We're only a drive away from Santa Monica, a jump away from West LA, a skip away from Century City, and stones throw from Culver City. As a result, I've had the experience to dine at many scrumptious restaurants, restaurants I'll miss dearly when I eventually move.   One such restaurant is Versailles, where I've been frequenting for years. I've never had a bad meal at Versailles. The service is always quick, the workers are always friendly, and most importantly, the food is always delicious. As a bonus, the plates are huge, usually big enough for two meals for me.  I've tried many dishes: the garlic chicken (its true what they say: they put crack in the sauce), shrimp in garlic sauce, streak strip, shredded beef, grilled pork chop... BUT for the past year or so, I've ONLY ordered the oxtail stew. The sauce... the tenderness... add a couple splashes of Tapatio sauce, there's nothing better!\n",

      "Okay, so I've been a frequent Versailles visitor since I was introduced to it is a kid in my middle school days.  Every now and again when I, my friends, or visiting family members have a taste for exquisite ox tails, intensely flavored and tender garlic chicken, or cuban black beans with rice and sweet, sweet plantains, Versailles is the obvious choice.  I definitely prefer the one on Venice Boulevard, probably because it is the one I've most frequented due to circumstance.   Nonetheless, all of the Versailles establishments are phenomenal.  I'm a huge fan of all foods ethnic, and this place takes the cake in the realm of Cuban fare.  No one I've ever been with at Versailles has ever disliked their meal and there are always plenty of leftovers to take home, which is just dandy!  Now, here's a funny little story about one of my visits to Versailles.  My sister and I were invited by my cousin to attend a birthday celebration on behalf of one of her friends.  Since both of us love Versailles, it was an obvious yes.  My sister being the proactive leader that she is decided to attempt a reservation to accommadate our fairly large party.  She first called the Versailles on Venice and the dialogue went as follows:  Courtney: Hi, do you take reservations?  Versailles Guy: No, so sorry.  Courtney:  Well okay, how long would you say the wait is for about 10 people at 7pm?  Versailles Guy:  Ooooh, 7pm.  Very, very crowded time at 7pm.  Long, long wait for you and your friends.  Courtney:  Oh really?  Gosh, how long would you say the wait is then?  Versailles Guy:  Ohhhhhh, teeeen minutes!  Courtney:  Ten minutes?!  Versailles Guy:  Yes, teeeen minutes!  Courtney (Thinking in her head):  This guy seems a little off, let me try the one on La Cienga.  She calls.  Courtney:  Hi, do you take reservations?  Versailles Guy #2: No, so sorry.  Courtney:  How long would you say the wait is then around 7pm?  Versailles Guy #2:  Ooooh, long, long wait.  Long time.  Courtney:  Well, how long is that?  Versailles Guy #2:  Uhhhhh, teeen minutes,  When my sister re-hashed that story in the workers' accent, we were all dying of laughter since they clearly made it seem that our hopes for a seat or short wait was impossible at the 7pm hour on a Friday night.  \"Teeeeen minutes\" though, is not so bad in my book! ;  )\n",

We had a party of 10 people and we all left Versailles better then when we first got there...Super full and extremely Happy.  Atmosphere and staff was down home and friendly extremely comfortable we felt as if were visiting family and the party had just begun.  I had the Lechon which is marinated pulled pork that comes with black beans, rice and fried plantains.  It was perfect, the pork was succulent beans were cooked just right and the plantains were fried goodness. Other Cuban spots I've gone to on the west coast are mediocre at best but Versailles is as close to Cuba that you will get and this pisses Fidel Castro off.  My Moopy had the Ox tail and she loved it, her taste is like mine. I didn't get any of hers because we were both so involved in our own plates.  Drinks were great I had some Mexican Bohemia's and the ladies had sangria and mojitos. They liked them so much that they ordered about three rounds of them.   We finished My Moopy's Birthday dinner off with a tres leches cake that was on the house and this tres leches as well was perfection.  As for the prices well all I can say is great food for Cheap...Do not change Versailles, you are a great spot  for great Cuban cuisine in these hard times. You guys are the best in the west.\n",

      "As an out-of-towner, I have an excuse for not discovering this earlier. We came here on New Years Day for dinner, and the place was bustling with people. We were seated immediately which was nice considering the difficulty of parking outside. The restaurant exuded high energy as the tables around us chowed down on their large-plated entrees. If you're looking for high-class service, you won't find it here, but our server was as pleasant as he could have been while trying to flip his tables as quickly as possible.   Our 4 person table ended up ordering: 3 garlic porks (me included) and 1 oxtail (the BF's dish). The food arrived quickly and then it was chow time. Not usually a fan of plantains, I announced quietly to my bf, \"you can have these later.\" I mixed in my beans with the rice and got working on the shredded pork. It was very garlicky, but at least I won't have the only garlic-breath at the table. The flavors were simple but all there. I even started to eat the plantains (the sweetness offset the salty flavor of the rest of the meal), and had only one left for the BF by the time I finished.  For a first time visit, I thought the pork was a good choice. I had a few bites of the oxtail, and I felt that was a bit more flavorful. The menu seems to have so much more to offer than just their garlic signature. When I return, I'll definitely want to change it up.   By the end of the meal, I drank 2 glasses of water and would have drank more...but our server didn't refill my glass. Heavy on the sodium, this dish. I suspected as much before I started eating, but it was still good enough for me to stuff myself silly. The portions were large enough for a lunch portion doggy bag to take home.   One warning about the leftovers...it will stink up your fridge and the smell will linger there after you've consumed it. Mints are required for your breath and recommended for your ice box.\n",

The pork and the chicken famous plates are good too - loved the lemon/butter sauce. It is very unhealthy. It will also give you a food coma. LOL But - it is worth it! I finished my plate. Don't like plantains in general though.  Got french fries instead. They are crispy and not oily like other restaurants. I liked it. I'm glad this place is far from OC - The food is too good. The amount of food - too good to be true! $10 for all that meat, rice, beans, and plantains? Gosh. I will definitely go back...

The best thing to order is the Versailles garlic chicken. its really good and half a chicken. I've also had the Bistec  Picadito which was tasty and tender, with a little bit of fat on the meat. The plantains are delicious and the black beans are ok (gets cold pretty quick). Can't go wrong with the traditional Ropa Vieja either.  The flan ... wasn't that good when we had it. The croquette .. was worse- still frozen!  Service is hit and miss. I was once told they were out of sangria , only to see someone at another table seated 30 min after us drinking a sangria.

The bread they bring you in the beginning is aight, too buttery my fingers were soo shiny just holding the bread.

To avoid the crowds and the long lines, my friends and I decided to come for an early dinner. We were seated right away and 5 minutes later... a pitcher of Sangria was on our table. FYI: Their sangria is strong and it definitely creeps up on you...   The menu is pretty long and extensive so give yourself plenty of time to order. The main dishes are big and could be easily serve 2 people, if other smaller dishes are shared as well. I highly recommend the seafood paella,  garlic chicken, yuca frita and of course fried plantains.

I prefer this location to the one on La Cienega Blvd because the parking is more convenient here. Whenever I've tried anything but the roasted pork, I've regretted not ordering the garlic roast pork, so now I just stick with that. My rating is based solely on that dish. The other meat dishes, including the chicken, can be dry and bland. Most of the flavor comes from the garlic mojo sauce, which could use more garlic. But with all the rice, beans, and fried plantains you get, it really hits the spot. Unfortunately, this place used to be known for being cheap and filling. They've raised prices, so the cost is just average, but it's still filling.\n",

      "Where to start with Versailles...  Well, I grew up eating at this hole in the wall, amazing, friendly restaurant. For as long as I can remember, my parents would take me and my little sisters here every time we step foot in California.  Since I was a kid, my order stayed the same whenever I go to Versailles. Chilindron de Cordero - Cured sauteed lamb, simmered in tomato, herbs/spices and wine sauce. And after having bites from friends' and family's dishes, the lamb is my favorite. Never have I ever had lamb so tender, to the point where if you press your fork slightly onto it, it falls apart. Why settle for the typical beef and chicken? Live a little and try the lamb, if you haven't already. You'll fall in love. The wine sauce that it's swimming in is rich and flavorful. The rice is by far my favorite rice I've ever eaten. And I eat rice everyday. I don't know what they do to that rice, but its damn good, even alone. Slightly sweet and buttery, in my opinion.  The plantains, the sweet  fried plantains. Without them no dish at Versailles would be complete. Mildly sweet, creamy and a little crispy all at the same time. Then comes the black beans in its own little bowl. I'm not a fan of beans, but I will be for these black beans. Most people mix the beans into their rice but, I prefer to eat everything separate, so I can enjoy each item on my plate individually.   I know the combination of meat, plantains and black beans sound like an odd mix, but don't knock till you've tried it. I brought my picky/hard to please boyfriend here and he loved it. He ordered the Ropa Vieja but, couldn't keep his fork away from my plate. If you're scared to try new places, come here. You won't be disappointed. I promise. Whatever you order, make sure you ask for extra onions on the side! Yes, they're raw. But don't be frightened, they have this to die for vinegary taste to them and it works really well with the rice and meat.  Service for me is always perfect. Friendly, fast and helpful. The parking however, scares the crap out of me. If you're claustrophobic, you might want someone who isn't park the car. It gets a little crowded. Other than that, I have no complaints.   *Versailles will please even the pickiest tongue.\n",

      "Wow, I really loved this place!.. so much in fact that a few days later I tried the one on La Cienga in LA.    I went with a group of friends and would have left (because of the line out front) had we not had to wait for a last friend to arrive before revising plans.  By the time the friend arrived, we realized the line was moving pretty quickly and decided to stay.  I'm so glad we did.  I've eaten at other Cuban restaurants before, in San Jose and Las Vegas, but never cared much for the food... Versailles changed my attitude on Cuban cuisine!  We started with the sampler platter and I liked everything on it!  I can't tell you the names really but it was all so good, that I suddenly was excited about dinner.  Though I normally try to stay away from 'fried' stuff, I ordered the deep-fried cubes of pork (because of the sampler platter).  They were great, swimming in what seems to be a commonly used house lemon garlic sauce (it was on the chicken dishes too).  My friends were nice enough to let me try their plates too.  The Cuban sandwich was great as were Pork plates #1 and #2.    The environment was loud and festive, with the lights going out several times to sing different versions of Happy Birthday to people.  They were able to push tables together to accommodate our group of 7.  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  All in all... it was a great experience that turned my thoughts about Cuban cuisine around completely!  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area.  See ya there! :)\n",

I thought I would be brave and go for something on the right side of the menu... and it was worth it! Most people order pork it seems. This is as  safe a bet as you are going to have here. Their plantains are soooper yum.\n",

The fried plantains were a bit overcooked, and lacked any consistent shape.  It doesn't take much for the imagination to come up with other things that these plantains may resemble....(you fill in the blank)  I had the special of the day- the roasted leg of lamb- which came out with no bone.  Again, solid food, but nothing special.  The garlic mojo sauce touted by the menu just seemed like an overdose of lemon.  We probably won't come back the next time we're back in the area.\n",

I had the Lechon Asado and it just melted in my mouth.  The onions are just barely sauteed, so if you don't like onions on the raw side, you may not care for their onions.  I, thankfully, like onions in all forms.  My husband had the garlic chicken.  It just came right off of the bone it was so tender.  I also don't know how I did it, but I saved room for flan and boy was I glad that I did.    We have returned a few times since that initial visit and have been happy each time.  The only drawback to this place is the parking.  They make the Hollywood Bowl parking lot look like a masterfully orchestrated lot.  ;)\n",

      "My little tip for enjoying the famous versailles chicken without waiting in line or spending much money:  I call it in for pick-up, take it home, and split it with my live-in. It is enough for two people, it's a whole chicken! For about ten clams, with rice and beans and the yummiest plantains. One time we ordered extra beans and it worked out great. Another time we ordered extra beans and thought we didn't have to. Still trying to figure that out. If you have a sald at home or a dessert or something, you don't even have to worry about it....  For five bucks a person, we eat good in our neighboorhood and don't have to cook. I know if I tried to cook a chicken that good I'd spend way more then ten bucks and fail miserably on the deliciousness level....\n",

      "I've been to Versailles with my wife on two occasions.  The first time I went and got the dish for which the restaurant is known: the chicken with onions in a brown, garlic sauce.  The idea of the sounded great.  However, for me, it was nothing special.  The sauce came across as kind of tangy...in an overpowering way.  I'm ok with strong flavors and garlic, but this didn't jive with me the right way.  The chicken and onions seemed cooked well enough, but it just didn't impress like I had hoped it would.  And for the price (not unreasonable, but not dirt cheap) I was hoping to be happy.  My wife agreed with my sentiments.  The second time we went, I went for the Paella.  I remembered from the first time we had gone that we would have to allow for 30 to 45 minutes to prepare the paella, so we went with that in mind.  The notion of a big helping of steamed seafood with sauce and rice sounded great.  The price for this dish was pretty significant (I believe it's for a party two people to split) so I had high expectations for the delivery of this as well.  It came out in a timely manner and looked good, but I recall that there were lots of shells on the shellfish still (like the crab and shrimp) which made the dish challenging to eat.  It also didn't have any...pizazz (for lack of a better term) to really get me excited and happy about the choice I had made.  Again, my wife shared my sentiments.  I think I'd be willing to go one more time since there is so much positive feedback for the restaurant, but I have a feeling that Cuban food done the \"Versailles way\" is just not for me.  Sad, too.  Summary: The famous dish didn't excite me, nor did the expensive Paella.  Maybe it will excite you, but this restaurant seems to be a very subjective experience.\n",

It just made me sit there and say \"WTF\"... how could I  POSSIBLY have such unflavorful food (I believe it was fish)??  I might have enjoyed a filet of fish from McDonald's more.    A friend of mine got the squid steak... the funny thing is it looked EXACTLY like my fish, but tasted worse, and it was rubbery.    [side note] Someone should tell Versailles, that in the last few years, there has been a SQUID REVOLUTION, and squid is no longer served rubbery.  Back in the early 90's, calamari / squid was always rubbery no matter where you went.  Nowadays, people understand it better, and it's usually quite good at a decent restaurant. [/side note]  Another friend of mine who was there, loved his food.  It was some kind of beef stew.  I thought it tasted horrible and the beef was tough.  It should've been slow cooked to tenderness, but it tasted like they tried to make it fast and failed miserably.  Then the 4th person in the group got some kind of chicken.  It was ok.   The only thing I liked at Versailles was the plantains.  But plantains are always good.    Good luck making me come back here, you might need to get me drunk first and then trick me into going.\n",

There's way too much for one person but I suppose leftovers might make a nice sandwich. I'm not a fan of the skin- it's hard and thick and difficult to maneuver (--what she said)   Surprisingly the PORK ended up being way better! It's just as garlicy but it's softer- reminds me of BABY BLUES pulled pork.  The sangria is 2.95 a glass and you get a full glass of vodka that tastes like there might be some juice in it. Service was just OK...it wasn't too crowded on a tuesday night but they neglected our water throughout the meal. They were nice when they came by though.  FYI There are only two vegetarian dishes on the meat-heavy menu and they consist of the sides that come with the meat dishes- beans, rice, plantains.   I doubt I'll be back soon- I think its one of those kinds of places where you go because you're craving a really garlicy half a chicken and some mushy sweet banana things.\n",

What I will rave about is the pork!  The pork is marinated and it melts in your mouth! Very flavourful and tender. The plantains are hit or miss, sometimes they are sweet and other times they have been on the bitter side (obviously fried before they were ripe enough)  ATMOSPHERE:  Screaming brats are not my thing (hey, I am more of  a dog person) and this place always seems to have too many of them so do not expect a relaxing dinner. The tables always seem to have that dirty dishrag smell as well and I do not like that!  The waiters are always friendly and accomadating but there is definitely an assembly line feel to Versailles so I generally prefer picking up my food.

The service was fine, we were seated quickly and our food was delivered quickly as well.  I ordered the classic garlic chicken which was greasy and nothing to rave about.  The dish is also served with black beans and rice and plantains.  These parts of the dish were my favorite, and were pretty tasty, but I CAME for the CHICKEN!  Geoff ordered some meat variation.  I am not sure what it was, but it was unedible.  The meat tasted like middle school cafeteria delicacy, if you get my drift.  He ate my chicken, the beef remained untouched.  The server noticed this and didn't say anything, which surprised me.    For dessert, Geoff ordered the flan... it was whatever.  Granted I was born and Miami and know good Cuban food, but this place was a let down. I do not think Versailles is a place I will visit again.\n",

Chicken?! If I want chicken, I'll go to Roscoe's.  The meat is so tender, moist and succulent, the perfect combination of tangy and savory flavors, that it would be reason enough to love Versailles. But it's only one part of a finely balanced composition that includes rice, black beans, onions and plaintains... when you get all these elements together on your plate, it's gastronomic nirvana.

      "Let's see, where do I begin with this one?  Okay- My initial reason for going to Versailles was because of all the good comments they have gotten. Everyone talked of how the food was so good and plentiful. For some reason they did not mention how loud, smoky, and obnoxious the atmosphere is. Maybe they are used to this sort of thing.  I decided to have dinner here on a Saturday night. From the entrance the place seemed quiet and pleasant. That bubble quickly burst once I entered and was seated.  The place was smokey with a burnt, greasy odor in the air, like when you  leave something on the stove and it begins to scorch. What's more, I was really taken aback by how LOUD and OBNOXIOUS the other patrons were. They were all being boisterous and trying to talk at once. After awhile I realised that many of them had gotten liquored up before going there for dinner.  The food was okay. I ordered the #6 : It was their signature chicken with rice and black beans. I got an entire plate of rice and a TEACUP of black beans, which is disproportionate in my opinion. The chicken was good with it's warm and flavorful sauce. However, it is not something I could'nt make. [ The #6 is described as half a chicken. For some reason customers gush about how they got \"like half a chicken, dude\". Again, the menu says just that. Surprise!!]   The bread (sourdough?) was decent. They do not have fountain drinks. Only canned sodas which you have to purchase individually.  Out of about 200+ reviews only one other person said she felt uncomfortable sitting among people who talked loud and stared. I must say, If you are loud, obnoxious, and have no class you will fit right-in here. I'm guessing that weekdays during lunch may be a little quieter than weekends and eves.

There's a huge colorful sign that says \"Cuban Food\" right out front, so it's hard to miss this place.   *Roasted pork ($7.99): awesome! Reminded me of carnitas. If you like the combination of lemon, vinegar, and garlic, you'll enjoy the pork a lot. This dish also came with lots of onions, plantains, black beans, and rice.The plantains were fried, and had a nice sweet taste to it. The black beans tasted pretty good, though I'm usually not a huge fan of beans.  *Roasted chicken ($7.99): I tried a bit of my friend's order, and it tasted pretty good. It seems like they pretty much give you half a chicken, so if you're really hungry, this is a good option. It's also marinated in the same sauce as the pork. This also comes with plantains, rice, and black beans.   *Materva ($2.99): Cuban apple soda. It's pretty good, and it's sweetened with cane sugar.   *Ironbeer ($2.99): beer fortified with iron supplements.....  I wish. It basically tastes like a sarsaparilla/tropical root beer.   Overall, the food here is pretty good and the service isn't bad. The restaurant is spacious enough, but it gets packed fast. The parking lot is really cramped and it can be hard to back out.  So beware of bad drivers.\n",

We came here on a Saturday night, without any kind of reservation, and we were slightly discouraged at first by the sight of a crowd of people waiting outside.  We went inside and we were told that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table.  They don't take any names here, but rather have everybody get in line outside, and as tables become available, they just seat the next party in line.  We didn't have to wait very long - maybe 15-20 minutes to be seated.  Our orders were taken very quickly after that, and our food was brought out not too long after that.  They were extremely efficient with the whole order process, and also with checking up on us every once in a while.  Service was excellent.  If someone in the dining room is celebrating a birthday, they turn off the lights and sing happy birthday to the lucky person.  Everyone in the restaurant joins in.     Very very friendly atmosphere in general.  Reasonably priced too.  Probably not a romantic \"date restaurant\" but rather a casual, laid-back, talkative, friendly dinner type restaurant.    To conclude, I'd definitely come here again in the future.  Very highly recommended.\n",

I don't know how they cook the plaintains, but this is one of the only places where I will eat them.   The moros rice was a little dry this time, but the flavor that the black beans added nullified the dryness.   I took a couple friends who have not had Cuban food before. We went around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and luckily the rush hour just died. We were lucky to park right in front of the restaurant, not to say there was lack of parking. We waited in the line outside for only about 10 minutes - not bad.   My two other friends ordered the chicken and yellow rice and one of the beef dishes. Both tasted very good and if I ever wanted an alternative to my usual garlic chicken or roasted pork dish, I would get the yellow rice and chicken. It comes in a HUGE portion with half a chicken nestled in the middle of a mound of yellow rice. However, be sure to eat the chicken fast (or at least strip the meat off of it to soak in the rice) because by the end of the night, the chicken was dry and she didn't want to finish it.

      "Wonderful place for Cuban food in LA.  Seating is prompt and the servers are always very friendly.  They start you off with buttered bread that is delicious.  I also opt for an appetizer of fried yucca which comes with the garlic sauce that covers the chicken dish.  I've gone multiple times but have only tried the garlic chicken and roast pork.  Personally, I like the pork better since it is always moist and tasty while the chicken is hit or miss juicy.  But everything is always complemented well by the perfect combo of protein--rice and beans.  They serve a decent selection of bears and other alcoholic beverages, but if you're in the mood for something different, try one of the native sodas (ask the server for the flavor translation).  All in all, fast, friendly, yummy, and cheap since I can never finish the huge portions and end up having another great meal the next day.\n",

      "What's there to say that the 500+ reviews haven't said yet? The 4-5 Yelp rating is on-point. Really great tasting Cuban Food. My fav is still the Famoso Pollo (Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken). Half a chicken with lemon-garlic sauce topped off w/ slices of onions. Lechon Asado (Cuban Style Roast Pork) is a close second. And guess what, for those who like both... they have a combo plate of both!  The restaurant itself has a very vibrant feel to it. I'm assuming it's a tribute to its Cuban roots. The service is always excellent, always friendly. Very group friendly. Accommodated 18 for a Sunday lunch very easily without a reservation.\n",

      "This place is amazing. I had the halibut, it was just my god...it was drool worthy, I wish I was eating it again right now. Being a cuban restaurant they serve rice and beans with everything too and I hate rice and beans, but I LOVED the rice and beans at this place...  My friend said that this place is extremely popular and that they're always packed, especially at lunch. He was describing how long the line will be which I figured was him exaggerating, but I don't know...I'd probably wait in line for this place. I'm definitely going to try to go back on my next visit which is fast approaching.  Oh yeah, the service was sub-par, but it apparently wasn't worth remembering bc I'm just now realizing that I didn't complain about it during my review until now.  Eat here often, I will.\n",

      "After reading all the superlative reviews of Versailles, my friend and I felt obliged to go.  We took everyone's advice and ordered the garlic chicken, and a strip steak, since I wanted some type of steak and the waiter recommended this one.  The chicken was fine, not a fraction of what I expected, and it even tasted dry if I didn't douse it in the lemon juice/sauce covering the plate.  It was worth finishing at least, unlike the steak strips which tasted like the first steak I ever tried to make but ended up feeding to my dog.  The steak tasted so much like chewy rubber that my friend and fellow yelp enthusiast said it reminded her of cafeteria food.  We optimistically ordered the flan, hoping it would make up for the first half of the meal, but it didn't.   If I wasn't having my wisdom teeth taken out the next day (which means no food for the 8 preceding hours) I probably wouldn't have forced myself to finish any of the food.  Yelp I love you, but for the first time you led me astray.\n",

      "I remember my ex-bf's brother saying he went to LA and had the best chicken of his life. He was skeptical at first, but it was heaven. I was so confused. Best chicken of his life? Really? How good can roast chicken possibly be.   On one of my bff's visits, we decided to finally make it here. We were greeted happily and seated in the colorful dining room. They gave us menus and a basket of awesome garlic bread. It reminded me of this garlic bread my mom and I used to make with lawry's garlic spread (basically butter, garlic, and lots of salt. We ordered ham croquettes, garlic chicken, and a grilled porkchop.   The ham croquettes were shaped like chubby mozzarella sticks. They were crispy with a smooth and salty ham filling. Then the entrees came. I can never resist plantains and they were excellent. It also came with the traditional black beans and rice. The pork chop was vinegary and flavorful. My ex-bf's brother was right. The garlic chicken was perfection. It was super juicy and had a crisp garlicky skin that tasted like a huge garlic potato chip.   I'm sure everything else on the menu is just as good. I can also see it getting old if you go there too often because it all does boil down to meat, plantain, beans, and rice. The chicken here is definitely worth a visit though.\n",

Plantains.  Large portions.  Big hunks' o meat (easy there ladies).  Black beans and rice. I doubt there's anything on the menu that wouldn't hit the mark.  It's pretty quiet and dark in here.  It's not a bad date idea if you don't mind the breath you'll have after this.  (Did I mention the garlic bread here is most tasty?)

To warn you ahead of time, I am not an expert on Cuban food, but this had good reviews on Yelp and we wanted to try something different.  He ordered the roasted pork, which came with rice and beans. I ordered the garlic chicken, which came with the same. We ordered by number, so we didn't feel ridiculous trying to pronounce anything. The server was friendly and our food came about about 15 minutes after we put in our order - the place was pretty quiet due to time of day, I would guess. My chicken was really, really good, and so were the rice &amp; beans. I tried a bite of the pork and it was moist and flavorful. The price was right as well - thirty bucks for two dinners with leftovers, a beer and a soda is pretty good nowadays. Again, I'm not expert and have no idea if this is authentic Cuban food or just a pasty imitation, but our dishes were both great, and I would definitely come back.\n",

      "I'm going to start by saying that when it comes to Versailles you DEFINITELY need to watch which location you go to.  The location on Venice is very good.  The locations in Manhattan Beach and Encino are terrible.  Just a head's up...  And now to the food.  Everything is good, not great.  The chicken is cooked properly, and the steaks are okay, although they use the same garlic sauce on everything at the restaurant.  The plantains are usually cooked properly... slightly caramelized on the outside, tender on the inside.  And the rice?  Well, they don't mess it up, so it's rice.  The fruit drinks are tasty treats, and the appetizers are all pretty decent.  Desserts are okay, nothing too crazy here.  The best part is that all of the prices are reasonable, so you really get what you pay for.  Versailles isn't 5 star dining, but at these prices no one would expect that.  It's a good place to go with coworkers for lunch, or for a casual dinner.  I give them 3 stars.  Nothing crazy good, but no complaints.  Well, except for one.  They should get a little bit creative and come up with another sauce, because honestly guys, your garlic sauce is pretty damn mediocre.\n",

      "I have been to Versailles many times over the past 10 years. It generally rocks. However things started to change when they did an overhaul of the place. It lost it's hole-in-the-wall-with-great-food vibe when everything was uniformly painted and there were fancy wrought iron chandeliers with fancy lamp shades. Then I went in a couple of days ago and they have redone their menu, not only have prices gone up (which is fine it wasn't a crazy hike) but it looks like the menu from a chain restaurant like Denny's, Chili's or Claim Jumper. Everything is so ... nice. Again not a bad thing just different. I also noticed that the chicken wasn't as savoy and neither were the beans. Hope it was just an off night with the food.\n",

      "Look, I realize there's some dispute on the matter here. But allow me to state, categorically, this place does not deserve a line every night.   It is PASSABLE Cuban food that is considerably overpriced with an ambiance that lies somewhere between Sharky's and El Torito that just finally got their B back out front.  Okay fine, one star for the energetic waiters in white. And another for the decent Cuban beer. But that's where I stop. Cause when it comes to the food, frankly? It's just not that good. Their sandwiches are half as good as Porto Cuban bakery and their pork can't hold a candle to places in the valley.  So it's my considered opinion that other people standing on line must be there for something other than Cuban food. Maybe it's puppies. Or human growth hormone. Or Blockbuster coupons.   That's the only rational answer. Otherwise, it's just admitting that, in a city with tremendous discretion when it comes to Mexican food, we just can't somehow tell the difference when we say the rice and beans are from land of Ricky Ricardo and not Pancho Villa.\n",

      "I felt gypped!  While the ambiance is not much to mention, it is authentic with mostly Cubans dining here. Along with the Cuban beverages. I had to order a Malta soda! Saw this drink used in a Cuban BBQ on Food Network months ago and was curious. More on this later...  The BBQ chicken, was fried chicken -- had better -- with what tasted like BBQ sauce out of a bottle. Uhm, and even the waiter recommended that of the choices I was interested in.  Honestly, I felt like I ordered the wrong thing. At least the drink was good.  Malta, for those who haven't tried it is like a mixture between a root beer and a regular beer. Kinda reminds me of a flat stout beer, but sweet. It's got this molasses-type of flavor. Tasty, different, and now I understand why it went into that BBQ I saw on TV -- it's got a nice flavor for that sort of thing.\n",

      "There is just absolutely no way in hell my 1-star vote  can bring down the average 4 stars.   Fact is I started dining here since 5 years ago. I was a poor grad student 2 blocks away and the food served here was like heaven. Back then the garlic chicken was $8.95. Tons of rice, beans and plantains. My other 2 favorites include fried breaded pork chops and red whole red snapper.   Since moving away from this hood, we never had time to revisit. Yesterday we did.   First off, yes, you can still feel the presence of grad students hanging there.   Second, Versaille remodeled the interior! Gone are the fugly curtains! Hooray!   Third, prices went up by $2. Garlic chicken now $10.95, pork chop $12.95 etc. And of course smaller portion of rice + beans etc.   The 1-star isn't so much because of the last bullet point. Ok, so rising operational costs means we have to fork out a little more. That's fine. But that doesn't mean the quality of the food has to go down. That's my problem with restaurants these days. They take the opportunity to increase the profit margin in both directions.  The chicken tasted blend and the garlic sauce ain't that garlicky anymore. I recalled that the fried chicken skin literally melted in my mouth. They don't anymore. And how difficult is it to fry breaded pork chops? I have done it at home and the texture always come out just right. Apparently very challenging for Versaille. The chops were tough (overcooked) and the breaded skins fell off even before entering my mouth. I was eating chops and breaded flakes separately. Perhaps Versaille should take a lesson from the Japanese how they did their Katsu Chops.  Just one more point if any one don't know this yet. Yes the chicken are pre-fried and placed under a heat lamp. So there you are eating KFC-operational style food. Plus when Versaille does it, it's somehow still approved as an  \"A\" restaurant. Now, when SamWoo does that for roast duck, they get a \"B\".   Restaurant rating ethnically biased? Perhaps. But something to ponder.\n",

Of the restaurants I frequented while living in the neighborhood, Versailles had plopped itself down near the bottom of my list.  Nothing too special, but nothing terrible either.  Nonetheless, this past Tuesday I found myself headed here (against my will, of course) with Richard L. and some friends who had never been; it came highly recommended from some (other) friends.  I figured, worst come to worst, I'd just a eat a heap of plantains.  I like those.  Of course, eater-of-words that I am, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit this time 'round; the inside has gotten a face lift since I'd last come, with nicely painted stucco-colored walls, better lighting, and decent decor.  The service seemed a bit more attentive as well.  And the food, well.  The garlic bread starter was warm and buttery, and the camarones con arroz amarillo were pretty darn good.  The pulled pork looked amazing, though I didn't try it myself.  Oh, and I think I mentioned that I love plantains...  I was not disappointed on that front.  They were delish!  I told Richard L. that maybe we would come back again BEFORE three more years have passed.

      "This location was recommended by a Cuban as the best Versailles in Los Angeles.  Well I found their food to be quite disappointing!  I ordered their famous 1/2 garlic chicken with white rice, black beans and tostones instead of maduros.  For those unfamiliar with plantains, tostones are from the green plantain and the maduros are yellow and sweeter.  Starting with the chicken, I wasn't crazy about it.  The skin had a nice crunch but the vinegar citrus marinade sauce was too overwhelming.  That seems to be my issue with Cuban food.  They use too much vinegar and citrus in their meats.  The white rice was fine but the beans had no taste whatsoever.  The tostones were the best thing.  I may give Versailles another try one day, but I doubt it since their signature dish isn't that good.  The portion size was nice but almost $12.00?  It should be more like $8.  I hate to sound biased since I'm half Puerto Rican, but I prefer it over Cuban.  Puerto Rican is better seasoned and doesn't use so much citrus and vinegar.  The problem, there are hardly any Puerto Rican restaurants in LA.  To be fair though, I haven't been to many Cuban restaurants in this town.  I'm open to suggestions.  So far the best tasting I've had is Havana Mania in Redondo Beach.  Everything there is so flavorful!\n",

      "This place is a favorite of my Cuban friend. I tried a few dishes....some I really liked, some were okay. My favorite is the oxtail stew.....5-6 pieces of chunky but tender oxtail in this shimering tomato broth over rice. Every plate comes with a side of plantain and blackbean as well...but I would go with extra rice to soak up all the tomato broth.  The roast garlic half chicken is good, but a bit too oily for me.  It it swiming in butter. I prefer the shredded roast pork than the chicken.  A great alternative for the westsiders.\n",

      "WOW! WOW! WOW! Ok seriously... this place is amazing. A-FREAKING-MAZING. The first time I went here was maybe 10 years ago? I was visiting my cousin in LA and she took me here.... I had the Garlic Chicken and it ROCKED MY WORLD.   Years later I was in LA with my then bf and I never got so flustered when I found out he gave me wrong directions with our map so we didnt make it back to Versailles! I now don't eat meat so alas I will never have the infamous chicken again...sigh...but i encourage everyone to try the Garlic Chicken here it's to die for.  I love blackbeans and Plantanos! mmm mmm. But now that im a veggiegirl i probably wont go back considering there is like 1 or 2 things that you can get on the menu.\n",

      "Been here a coupla times; excellent experiences. If you're looking for a place to get the bang-bang-boom for your buck, come here.   Note: don't expect to keep up with your Weight Watchers program when you eat here!  Yes, it's THAT good.  I ordered the garlic chicken.  It's awesome.  You get a hefty portion of chicken, rice,  black beans, and platanos.  May I say that this dish screams pungence?  It does.  A variety of different tastes that compliment each other in perfect harmony and balance.  Oh God, the food here does things that I'd only expect behind closed doors.    Servers are busy here, but for good reason - this place is packed!  Nonetheless, they were prompt and friendly.   It's a long drive from where I live, but this is one of those places - when the mood strikes - that I'd make the sole destination of my drive.  Try it.   You won't regret it.\n",

      "One of my OG favorite restaurants, Versailles stands as a great Cuban restaurant for the West LA area.    Can't go wrong with the garlic chicken; so much food it can feed you today AND tomorrow.  And how can you resist a platter that comes with friend plantains?  The Rabo Encendido(oxtail) dish is solid, but I'd still recommend the one at Havanna Mania.   The shakes are also pretty good.    Very roomy locale, friendly service, and room for big parties.  A good find in my book.    I used to live in the apartment complex immediately behind this place when I was a little tyke, but sadly, I didn't discover Versailles until my senior year in high school, 10 years later!  So make sure you always venture about your home and seek out those great places to eat!\n",
