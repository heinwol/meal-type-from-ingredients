      "I'd been here several years ago, and I went back because I had a temporary job in the area.  While the vegetarian drunken noodles weren't bad, the tofu dish was really bad.  I can't imagine how it has stayed in business this long, considering that downtown DC is an area just filled with really good restaurants.  Save your money and go to Kanlaya or anyplace else but here.\n",

      "Went  here on a Monday night during my business trip with a coworker.  The place was pretty empty (it was around 9 on Monday night) but the waitress came right out to us.  She made some rec's for us as my friend is Vegan pretty much.  Prices are very low to mid range and portions were really good for $15.  We had the tofu pad thai w/o egg (i kno, it needs egg but is ok w/o XD,) tofu red curry (friend asked for it to be extra spicy and it was XD,) vegetable dumplings, and Volcano seafood entree.  Waitress brought our drinks and then a young man started taking care of us, seems like he had limited English proficiency but he really tried to answer my friends questions so points for that.  After ordering all this food, we asked about how long it would be and he said 5 minutes, it was more around 20 minutes.  After the little wait, the food came out piping hot and was decent for the price range.  I would consider it pretty average Thai food, but I was looking for something better than a quick fast food chain.  I left satisfied with some pad thai for the next day.  Took off a star because the waitress had an attitude when she had to explain DC's plastic bag thing to us and he it would cost me extra money.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but in DC I'm sure she serves plenty of people who don't know about the bag policy.  Took another star off because the restaurant was warmer than outside and my friends dinner had tofu in it when she requested no tofu.  I'd go there again if I had to, but I wouldn't make any special trips.\n",

      "Came here for lunch with two friends after a meeting in the area.   One of the worst places I've been too in a while.   We all ordered Thai Iced Teas and an order of fried vegetable dumplings to start. The Thai Iced Teas were flavorful, but tastedl like at least half a cup of sugar had been put in each one, I finished about half of mine and felt a bit nauseous. As for the the dumplings, they weren't horrendous, but were clearly from a frozen bag, 5 dollars for 8 dumplings? I could have bought a bag of 32 for 4 dollars at an asian market.   For our main dishes. I got the salmon in red curry sauce lunch special. My friends got the soft shell crab and the pad thai.   My salmon came out, and the inside was STILL FROZEN.  They apologized profusely and brought me out another one. I know this place isn't super clasy, but it really turned me off to know that my food was not fresh at all and simply heated after being taken out of a freezer and served to me. My friend's pad thai was sub par and tasted like it came out of a Trader Joe's pad thai box. (Note: Trader Joe's/ \"Trader Ming's\" pad thai from a box isn't that bad, but food from a restaurant shouldn't taste like it was just microwaved. )   The only reason this place didn't get one star is because my other friends soft shell crab was well cooked, it was overly sweet  but still tasted pretty good.   I hear they have good happy hour specials though, so I might be back. I do not recommend this place though.\n",

Ambiance was meh. Service was ok. Food was eh whatever. It was definitely pretty packed at lunch time. It's hard to justify eating here, though (outside of location convenience), when there are so many better Thai restaurants around DC.

      "My friend said, 'Meet me at Bangkok One'. It rang a bell because this restaurant was wedged between Tattoo and Lima - I remembered walking past it before. The restaurant was completely dead - I kept telling my friend perhaps it's still early in the evening until I tried the food. We had a waiter who didnt understand a word we said, and he stood there for minutes we felt really awkward. I wanted the Thai iced tea but I asked for that it was not too sweet and he couldnt understand that. After looking at this puzzled face, I asked for a coke instead.  For appetizer, I ordered the mango salad - it came out chunks of mangos with some onions and peppers I was dumbfounded. I expected the mango salad as unripened shredded mango like a papaya salad, boy was I wrong about that. For the entree, I ordered the Siam noodles with special spicy sauce, it was just seafood with the wide rice noodles and not the least bit spicy. I was disppointed with the dinner. The food tasted fine but it didnt wow me. Poorly executed Thai food.  With the same waiter we asked for him to break change for a $20, again he stood there for 5 minutes struggling to figure out what we were asking for. In the end an older gentleman walked up to us and took care of it.\n",

      "A great lunch spot in downtown DC.  Started with the summer rolls (vegetables and shrimp in a rice paper), which had a good flavor, were fresh and came with a peanut sauce. I would strongly recommend these. Also ordered the goong bikini appetizer (whole shrimp in friend  an egg roll type wrapper) with a sweet and sour sauce. These weren't bad but I would stick with the summer rolls instead.  I had the thai iced tea to drink. Give this a try...it's basically sweet tea with half and half or creme mixed in. It's really filling but give it a shot with your meal.   I had the massuman curry (beef with potatoes, onions and carrots in a curry sauce). The beef was well done and not fatty, the curry sauce had some sweetness and some spice with it. It almost reminded me a little bit of a beef stew but spicier and came with rice.  Depending on what you get it can be a little pricey for an everyday lunch but it's a definite place to go for an office lunch or to stop by once or twice a week. If you get it to go and skip the appetizer or drinks it's around $10.00 before tip, tax, etc.  Skip the mediocre places downtown and give this place a try instead.\n",

      "I had dinner there the first weekend I moved to DC. I can't remember what I had or what my friend had. But I don't remember that we were for or against it. I don't even remember what I had. So, not memorable.  I craved thai yesterday for lunch after my friend from Philly reminded me of our fave spot there. I went back b/c its th eonly thai place in walking distance (in the cold) near my office on 15th and H. I got take out.   Orderted the Tom Yum soup. It was fine but more coconutty than lemon-grassy which was weird. I love Thai and always order the Tom Yum so I could tell the odd difference right away.   Druken noodles. Also a favorite of mine. It was soupy. Yeah, not like chili pasty. But all the soupy-ness was at the bottom of the dish. The flat noodles were still white. I am used to it being seasoned. The chicken tasted odd. I didn't finish most of my dish. I always finish my thai.   Maybe b/c it was take out, and I didn't sit in that accounted for odd taste. But usually take out food isn't horrible.   I can't say positive or negative for the service. Order was ready on time as they said on the phone in 15 minutes. Thats about it.   I had to compensate for my awful thai lunch by going for thai dinner. And luckily my roomate new of a fabulous spot within walking distance to wear we live in Truxton Circle. 4th and NJ Ave I think. AWESOME drunken noodles and pad thai. Fresh salad. and great service. Will try their soup nexttime. I think it was Beau Thai but I can't remember the name.   p.s. DC Noodle House has great Pad Thai and Drunken noodles.  Wish they opened one near my job. Philly, if you are ever there, has multiple awesome thai places.\n",

      "OK, I made the mistake of going in at 12:30 during the lunch rush. After 10 minutes, I noticed that the people who came in at the same time as me AND the people who came in after me had already ordered and gotten their drinks. After 15 minutes as I was getting up to leave, the waiter came over and took my order. 25 minutes later my soup arrived. The table of 6 that sat next to me after I had been there for 20 minutes was already eating their entrees!. It really wasn't that busy as there were several empty tables. I may go there again even though it was awful, because the food is ok and it is right by the office. I hate having to settle for mediocre just because it's close by.\n",

      "The BKK dumplings kicked ass and were an amazing starter.  The rest of the food was pretty mediocre though. We had fried tilapi fillet in a generic brown flavorless sauce, and some bland drunken noodles. The dishes were good enough and fresh but didn't make any impression on my palate.  I will probably be back because the location is convenient and it isn't expensive. Also since we were the only couple in the restaurant at 7pm on a tuesday, service was super.\n",

      "We hit up Bangkok One this weekend because we'd seen it walking by a few times and decided to check it out. This was a bold move at the time, because we were literally the only people in the restaurant on Friday night at 7. You never know if it could just be an off-night during the summer, or if you're about to sign yourself for some late-night bathroom fun.   While this definitely doesn't make the winner's circle for my favorite DC Thai restaurants, it certainly wasn't bad. We both started off with shrimp tom yum soup that was flavorful and authentic. My fiance had the drunken noodles and I had tofu with peanut curry, both of which were palatable and large portions, if not the best I've ever eaten. I ended the meal with some mango and sticky rice that was the perfect consistency and taste--it's one of my favorite sweet treats.   The restaurant itself is clean but nothing to write home about in the decor department. It looks slightly dated. The service was polite and efficient.   It did seem that they got a lot of orders for pick-up while we were in there, and given that it's at 14th and K I imagine it's more of a lunch crowd. But it'd be hard to believe it will be around much longer if what we experienced on Friday was the typical dinner rush.\n",

      "I keep telling myself I'm not coming back here, but it never fails, I come back.  Last time I was there, the manager made a stink because I had a gift certificate he thought was expired (it wasn't... it was valid for a year, but that didn't stop him from call the 1-800 number of the place I purchased the certificate from to check).  The time before that, the waiter forgot about us entirely. And the time before that, the waitress did the same (on top of not saying one word to us).  Still, for some reason or another, at least once every 6 weeks or so, I find myself back in the small restaurant, staring mindlessly at the thai art replicas and pasty lilac walls.  It's convenient (around the corner from work) and the food is decent, but the real reason I keep coming back is Bangkok One set my world on fire... well, really just my drink.   The Flaming Volcano, as its called, is the biggest drink in town, but has the smallest price (like $6 or something), and comes with a fiery lemon set afloat on a wave happy hour goodness.  The best thing about the Flaming Volcano is that, unlike the implied effects of its name, the drink actually goes down quite smoothly and is down right refreshing.  It was the perfect pairing for my seafood fried rice which was so spicy it cleared up my sinuses.  Also, the Flaming Volcano doesn't hit you while you are drinking it... it kicks in about 30 minutes after which I loooooved!  Made for a good base buzz as I continued with my festivities for the night.  LOL!  Recommendations for a Bangkok One Visit: 1) Getting a Flaming Volcano 2) Go at lunch time for food (same portions and quality as the dinner menu, but significantly cheaper), but  3) don't come at noon.  It's packed. Come after - more like 1:30ish.  That's perfect. 4) If you are on the job and don't want to drink in the afternoon, come after work for drinks.  They are all uber cheap.  It's like having happy hour specials around the clock and without promotion. 5) Food-wise, any of the fried rice dishes or Drunken Noodles are great.  I got the Goong Bikini for an appetizer (mostly because I liked saying the name so much) and it was pretty good... odd, but good.  Sticky rice is ok for dessert, but not a must have.\n",

      "Good lunch spot. Right next door to DC Coast on K St.  The gai eggplant is quite good  and the drunken noodles are up to snuff. The thai iced tea is sinfully good and bad for you (but its bad for you everywhere and not always sinfully good)  Its generally packed at lunchtime, if thats any sort of recommendation, but theres rarely a wait longer than 5 minutes. Great for large groups.\n",

      "And, with this, my search for a good Thai restaurant in DC continues.  I've been spoiled growing up as a Thai kid.  You eat really awesome food at home, and you kind of look for a reminder of that everywhere else you go.  This place is kinda average.  I was really happy with the random Thai pop music in the background (like American pop, but 5 years back!) and the waitress was really cool (and even joked with me in Thai, I like that).  The pad kee mao (drunken noodles) had a little much liquid at the bottom, but the lad na was actually quite true to form.    You can request things that aren't explicitly on the menu, btdubz, so if you want pad kee mao with beef instead of chicken, or something with seafood instead of whatevers, they'll gladly do it.  My friend also invited the waitress to go to Lotus across the street the next night.  I'm not exactly sure how that panned out.\n",

      "This place kicks booty for cheap, quick lunch (same food at dinner, prices several bucks more but still a fairly good deal).  Prices are a steal and you can actually dine in at this sit-down place and be in and out before your lunch hour is over!  Can't say that about many downtown sit-down joints.  I particularly like this place because of the hugely extensive vegetarian selection, a lot of which you don't see on most Thai menus.  Recommend the BKK Roll appetizer because you won't see it other places: a filling of veggies that includes sweet tofu stuffed inside a paper-thin crepe of egg.  Very interesting and delicious.  My entree of choice is the BKK Tofu, deep fried cubes of tofu served with mung bean sprouts in a sweetish, savoryish, thinnish sauce.  It's great.  Also the Pa Rum Jae with tofu, broccoli, chili and peanut, as well as the stir-fried portobello dish.    Good food, good service, good prices, in-and-out in under an hour...A-OK in my book.\n",

      "Horrible!!!!!!  Came in today for lunch because it was close to work and once I got seated they brought out some dishes that had burnt spices and the whole half of the restaurant started coughing. People were requesting to have their food boxed so that they could leave. The smell in the restaurant was awful and the table in front of me was covering their nose with a napkin while eating.   I had vegetable tom yum which tasted nothing like tom yum soup I had at any other Thai restaurant. Basically it was spicy broth with some carrots, which is not really tom yum. The Shrimp and Tofu Pad Thai had TWO shrimps and no tofu and no peanuts, it was just noodles and tasted completely off. What a rip off!!!! I will never come back!!!!\n",

      "An...interesting choice of restaurant. Tucked in amidst a number of high-end, swanky restaurants (replete with, of course, sofas outside) is Bangkok One. Of my time in DC, perhaps the strangest restaurant experience I've had.  First of all, the smell of the restaurant is very strange. It smells like a mixture of pineapple and sewage. Did not smell good at all.  Second, the service was prompt, though this could be explained by the fact that my girlfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday.   Third, the appetizer, the Vegetable rolls, tasted like they could have come out of a freezer at your local Giant. The Thai iced coffee tasted about what one would expect of Thai Iced Coffee, while my gf got the Thai Iced Tea (way too sweet).  Dinner and dessert: the worst pad thai I had ever eaten...ever. Noodles seemed like a mixture of undercooked and overcooked (if possible). Though the taste was ok (more peanuty than pad thais I've had before), it still was very sub-par. Dessert, though, was bar none the WORST dessert I have had in DC. Another review had classified the ice cream as \"old and stale\"- we got a red bean ice cream and that encapsulated the ice cream perfectly.  The only reason I give this two stars: it has a coupon on  http://restaurant.com , so our meal cost significantly less than it would have. Good if you want a cheap meal, but otherwise not worth it.\n",

The food is almost always excellent with good portion sizes (although they are a bit chincy with the rice and they charge you extra for more). The deserts are also a great bet and always nicely prepared. Alas, the service can be slow during the lunchtime rush and the servers are clearly overworked. The best part is the food quality to value ratio. Most dishes come in at $8 and $3 or $4 for deserts. Food of that quality, portion size and price is pretty hard to beat!\n",

      "Pad Thai is a dish by which Thai reataurants are measured.  This place failed miserably at pad thai. It was so bad that I suspect they had intentionally made it foul tasting.  That's right - foul.  The stale noodles came in this sour tasting liquid that was supposed to be its sauce.  The pre-cooked shrimps had absolutely no flavor and were simply tossed in with the noodles.  There might've been a few strands of beansprouts, but I'm not so sure.  There was nothing else present that could've given the dish some sort of palatable flavor.  I'm sorry I ever ate it.  I hope it doesn't give me the runs.  Would I give this place another try?  No, unless it's the only place area that still has food, and I've eaten all the grass at Franklin Park.  I really hate to give bad reviews.  It's somebody's livelihood that I'm opining about here.  But, this lunch was trully horrid, and shame on them for serving something like it to their customers.  If you are the owner, please heed my advice: fix your pad thai - immediately - before it tanks your restaurant.\n",

Two stars (vs one) only due to the fact that we had a  http://restaurant.com  gift certificate so we didn't end up spending a lot - otherwise, over priced (especially for dinner) and taste-less food. The appetizers actually were not bad, but the entrees were totally bland. $10 for half a plate of seasoned-less steamed veggies, no matter how quickly served is not worth the time or money.   However, at $3, cheapest, non-happy hour special, bottled beer I've yet discovered in the District.   oh and amusingly, the waitress, who was fine, no better, no worse, took it upon herself to add in a 20% tip...20% of the post-tax bill that is.

They were also being really nice to me for some reason.  I was reading my book at a table all the way in the back because I wanted to read and every time they came over and had to interrupt they looked so sorry for disturbing my reading.  I thought that was extremely cordial and deserves 4 stars.\n",

      "After finally leaving the office at 8:30 and cabbing to Fedex on I St. to get a package out before the last pick-up, the two starving souls wandered down the street and came to a stop in front of Bangkok One. The restaurant was very quiet compared to its neighbor DC Coast. We walked in the restaurant thinking maybe we won't get to eat there because they might be closed soon. To our delight, the very polite and timid Thai fella told us they are open till at least 11 if not midnight. Upon learning that, we flopped our butts down as he led us to our booth, passing one other couple.  Since it was so late, we didn't want to pig out like we usually would after a long day at work, so we decided to go with one appetizer and one entree to share. We ordered the Yum Mango (special of the month) as an appetizer, which was mango, onions, tomatoes, green beans in a spicy cilantro lime dressing, and drunken noodles an an entree. Of course, we asked for the dishes to be prepared Thai spicy. The Yum Mango came out really fast and it was DELICIOUS!!! The sweetness of the mango and the sourness of the lime dressing, fired up with Thai chili flakes, it was such a nice kick for your tastebuds. The drunken noodles came out 2 minutes after we finished our appetizer and it was the best drunken noodles I've had yet in the DC area. Usually when you get drunken noodles, the noodles come out swimming in a plate of oil and everything looks dark and greasy, which is precisely the reason I almost never order drunken noodles unless the craving for spicy grease creeps up on me. But the drunken noodles at Bangkok One was so different and wonderfully tasty. When the dish came out, I couldn't see the noodles. As I found out as I dug my chopsticks in, the noodles were covered by a yummy thick layer of stir-fried chicken (or beef or pork depends on what you order), and the noodles seemed and tasted like they were just boiled real quick instead of stir-fried. So they boiled the noodles, put them on the plate and then poured the chicken and the sauce over it. Since chicken doesn't absorb much grease and the noodles are boiled, the dish was light yet tasty.   I was so content after my appetizer and entree that I didn't feel the need to order dessert for once. Now I know where I'll be going for a late dinner next time I'm stuck in the office again while everybody else is out enjoying happy hour.\n",

Although it was mostly empty that night, it had plenty of seating; I assume it gets busy during lunch hour. We had the specials, with perfectly cooked shrimp and those clear glassy noodles, yummy. Pad Thai was great as well, but the best part was the Thai Iced Tea. Very aromatic and tasty. Few other couples came in as we were eating, but the waiter was still very attentive and nice. Decor is kind of cool, they have artifacts in little glass cases that are very pretty and nice conversation starters. Food is good, people were nice, and price was right!\n",

      "3 and a half.   We stopped by after finding out sizzling express was closed. We went inside and we were greeted by friendly servers who quickly seated us (it was kind of empty actually) and handed us our menus. Their decor is nice and on the bigger tables you get a pretty lotus flower (or something just as nice) floating in a bowl of water.   Their menu kind of surprised me but perhaps I am still a greenhorn in terms of Thai restaurants. It seemed to be bigger and had more variety than other Thai places I've been to. We ordered the chicken satay and Siam Noodles (I think thats what it was). The chicken satay was delicious. They offered more than enough of the peanut sauce which was a plus because I think thai places dont serve enough of it. The chicken itself was also very good. It was juicy and well spiced. Even without the sauce it was definitely was able to stand on its own. The Siam noodles had a lot of seafood, scallops, shrimp, clams, and possibly squid. The dish was spicy but the waiter was more than happy to provide a set of different spices to heat it up even more. The rice noodles themselves were ok, sometimes it tasted a bit \"hard\" like it had dried out or it wasn't cooked long enough.    Dessert was lychee ice cream and sticky rice with mangoes. The ice cream came in a very retro looking sundae cup (no idea what to call it) and came with a fan shaped spoon which was also very cute. It was fun eating with it, and by that I don't mean it was difficult, it was just fun. The ice cream was creamy and smooth but at times I could sworn I felt grains (ice). The sticky rice and mangoes were ok. Nothing spectacular, but at least the mangoes were perfectly ripe and sweet.   Not bad if you're in the area and can't decide. I loved the service and the food wasn't too bad either!\n",

However, the flavor was good, if a little mild. I didn't order any temperature, so that was probably my fault for not asking for more heat. All in all, this was a decent meal for a decent price.\n",
